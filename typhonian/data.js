ipsos="liber pennae praenumbra in the akasha-echo is this inscribed by the same mouth o mother of the sun is the word breathed forth and the nectar received by the same breath o counterweight of the heart is the manifest created and destroyed there is but one gate though there appear to be nine mime-dancer of the stars how beautiful thy weft and web a-shimmering in the fire-dark of space the two that are nothing salute you black flame that moves hadit the less and less one grows the more and more pra-nu may manifest do thou now speak to us the children of the time-to-come declare thy will and grant thy love to us then spake she that moves i hurl upon ye children of heru all ye who love the law and keep it keeping nought unto yourselves are ye a-blest ye have sought the scattered pieces of our lord ceasing never to assemble all that has been and in the realm of the dead have ye begotten from the dead the shining one ye then gave birth and nourished him thy land of milk shall have the honey also dropped down as dew by the divine gynander the pleasure and delight lie in the working the whole surpassing far the parts together the lord of parts is placed within his kingdom as done by beast and bird the land of sun is open but to children heed the eternal child his way is flowing-free and suited to the nature of your being a voice crieth in the crystal echo what means this showing-forth is time itself awry the hawk has flown but threescore and ten in his allotted course she smiles as beauteous as night behold he spreads his pinions yet in flight showering and shaking forth the golden light upon the hearts of men and wherein doth he fly and by what means the feather and the air are his to ride to bear him ever in his go-ing the pylons of the ages are unshaken firmly are they set the day of the hawk has but seen its dawning and will see its due measure according to the laws of time and space the voice then spoke then has the vision failed do i behold thee crookedly thinking thee to be whom thou art not she danced and whirled scattering starlight in her silent laughter i am whom i appear to be at times and then again i wear a triple veil be not confused above all truth prevails i am the unconfined who is there to say me nay to say thou shalt not pass who indeed may say thy time is yet to come when time itself is my chief serving-maid and space the majordomo of my temple indeed o voice of the akasha i am the means by which you speak by the same mouth that breathes the air do words of doubt pour forth in silence then do know me for i am come with purpose at this time to aid the lovers of the hawk to fly the word of flight who falters in the flight must thereby fall the greatness of the gods is in the go-ing when first ye fledged beloved of heru the shell which had protected long had broken upon the wings of will ye ventured forth gaining strength and power as ye flew ye gained all knowledge of the feathered kingdom whereby ye became as perfect as the sun the friends and teachers all became as brothers the regal swan the heron and the owl the raven and the cockerel did aid ye the beauty of the hawk himself was granted the virtues of the peacock the hummingbird and loon the eagle did reveal her inner nature and the mysteries thereof behold ye witnessed how with her lion she became the swan and the ibis of the abyss did show the knowledge ye flew o kings and hermits and ye fly even now within the bending loveliness of nu but there are those among ye and below ye who would snare your wings and drag ye from the sky look well within judge well your heart if ye be pure it weighs no more than i it will not bear ye down to the abyss for gold is light but lead is fatal unto flying plumb your own depths in truth and self-knowledge if aught would hinder thee it is thy doing behold this teaching now within the temple so saying she-who-moves assumed the form of the great black flame growing from the central shaft and billowing out into the void the children of heru beheld in silence and listened to her words form in their hearts behold this lens of stars now turning in space before ye men have named it well andromeda through it i flow unto the holy moondog and thence to ra and thence to ye o priests ye must not rest content whilst in the kingdom but strive and so exceed in what is done in love of the lady of the north and in will of the prince of the south do every thing soever in the power of the seven-rayed star do ye comprehend the beast and from had of the heart do delight in thy star-arched darling do all this and then pass beyond abandon aught that might distinguish thee from any other thing yea or from no-thing if the fowler would snare thee leave thy feather-cloak a-dangle in his hand and soar naked and invisible beyond but now as priests within the temple are ye here as kings and warriors magickians all the way is in the work the hidden one of the abyss now gives the two wherein is wrought the higher alchemy supporting earth is chthonos learn it well and all bonds shall be loosed for the will's working surmounting spirit there is ychronos whose nature is duration and the passing-away thereof the two are one and form the kingdom's essence who masters them is master of the world they are the utter keys of transmutation and keys of the power of the other elements the warrior-priests received the keys and placed them well within their robes to hold them hidden well above their hearts the black flame danced and dwindled becoming small a quill pen plumed and pointed there being naught upon which to write one among the priests came forth and laid his body's skin upon the altar as living parchment she-who-moves wrote thereon a word but shew it not before them in patience waited all the kings and hermits assured full well of final understanding the feather grew again and rounded close its edges becoming to their eyes the yoni-lingam the image came of ancient baphomet the horned one who spoke of old ye knew the key of two-in-one conjoined ye have lived and loved full measure as nu and had as pan and babalon the mystery of mine own image do ye also know for such a truth was for the ancient orders of the east and west bipartite has the race of man been in its span the father and the mother made a child i am the elder of the children true but now the younger rises to his day the nature of true alchemy is that it changes not alone the substance of the work but also changes thence the alchemist ye whose will it is to work thereby behold mine inverse image and consider well its meaning for thy task the showing of the image from out the yoni-lingam drifted forth a cloud violet and light-shot in the misty heart thereof a sound arose vibrating soft yet filling everywhere jeweled and flashing rainbow-lights from wings there hovered in the midst an humble bee striped gold and brown soft-haired and curved in form it shone its eyes unto the priests and kings assembled spoke then she-who-moves from out the mist surrounding this is the symbol of the work-to-come the great gynander in its earthly form the magickian shall grow like unto the bee as the aeon unfolds a leader and sign unto the race of man what then of its nature doth the bee show forth behold it is not male nor female in the singular it labors forth by day in constant flight an egoless do-er whose will and the hive will are but one it gathers up the flower-nectar flies to hive and there in pure comm-union doth its very body transubstantiate the nectar is now honey bee to bee it is transferred speaking all hive mysteries from and to each mouth by the same mouth that first ingathered is the honey spent the secret alchemy within the centres turning silver gold the hive now lives immortal with queens and workers drones and builder-bees soldiers foster-mothers all are one in constant life-renewal the hive breathes as one being for so indeed it is in the will of the hive is the will of the bee fulfilled each in its appointed place the bees work out their will in ordered harmony the image fades now the poised plume moves in dancing fashion unfolding from the center shaft long wings transforming to the shape of the dark vulture but know o children of the hawk a man is not a bee he may profit from the image thereof to learn of wisdom in the working behold in me another image for thy heart's instruction there rose before their eyes the tower of silence wherein the lovers of fire lay their dead the vulture form alighted soft therein and ate the flesh from corpses to the bone the wind howled desolate in this fearsome place fluttering the cerements about the ivory bones silently the winged one stared gore smeared about her beak into the eyes of each priest there assembled her baleful gaze did search in perfect peace did they behold her searching for each as warrior had made of death a brother deliberately then she unfolded out her wings and took to the wind and soared up from that place the giving of the word eternity then reigned infinite the veil that hung about them somewhere sometime the veil parted for a moment and she-who-moves strode forth more comely than mortal woman ever was she glowed in radiance of pearl and amethyst fine pleated linen was her gown girded in gold and silver and on her head a nemyss of starred blue her crown was but a single plume free-standing and in her hands the ankh and wand of healing unto each warrior-priest she moved embraced and kissed them then seated in the midst she spoke as comrade equally-ranked all ye who practice well the high art hearken there shall be nothing hidden from thy sight all formulae and words shalt thou discover being initiated by those whose work it is to aid the law of will ye have worked well in all that has been given upon the tree of life are ye founded in tetragrammaton have ye proceeded in all the beast hath given have ye practiced well ye have become hadit and nu and ra-hoor-khuit also as heru-pa-kraath did ye abide in silence ye know pan as lover and as godform and babalon is bride and self to you the forces of shaitan have ye engendered calling forth the nexus of the ninety-three wherein to work your will separation for the joy of union have ye known and alchemy is science to your art for those who know and will and dare and keep in

eye must vigil keep o warriors for the illusion is self-generate constant watchfulness is the first act the abyss is crossed by minutes every day if ye would dance the mask then mask the dance exquisite must be the art in this wise and balance in the centre be maintained or else ye shall give unwonted life unto thine own creations tread carefully this path of working mage a tool by will devised makes an ill master now in the mass the eagle must be fed upon what she has shared in making by the same mouth that roars upon the mountain is the word-act of no difference given and when will declares therein shall join the bee to add the gold to red and white the essence of shaitan is nectar here the temple is the hive the lion is the flower now betimes the eagle invokes the nature of the bee within the triple chambered shrine is the first nectar pooled the summons of the wand of pan awakens the portal-opening bliss and from the third and inmost chamber in joy supreme the sothis-gift quintessential mead bounds forth to join eagle-tears and lion-blood solve et coagula comm-union thereby whereof the cosmos itself dissolveth and re-forms by will and know if aught can be so ordered in the kingdom that three or more is zero as well as older truths then stirred the warrior-priests and of their number a nameless one stepped forth we know thee lady unspoken though thy name has been thus far but say now what was written on the manskin what is the word thou givest she smiled and drew out from her robe a parchment scroll shaped even as a star unrolling it she turned it roundabout so all might see ipsos what is this word o lady how may it be used in silent wisdom king and warrior-priest let the deed shine forth and let the word be hidden the deed is lamp enough to veil the face it is the word of the twenty-third path whose number is fifty and six it is the unspoken abode where the dance of the mask is taught by me tahuti watches without the ape i am the vulture also it is the chalice of air and the wand of water the sword of earth and the pantacle of fire it is the hourglass and tail-biting serpent it is the ganges becoming ocean the way of the eternal child it names the source of mine own being and yours it is the origin of this sending that channels through andromeda and set what race of gods do speak to man o willed ones the word of them is both the name and fact it is for thee mantram and incantation to speak it is to bring about certain change be circumspect in its usage for if its truth be known abroad it would perchance drive the slaves to madness and despair only a true priest-king may know it fully and stay in balance through his go-ing flight this is all i speak for now the book of the preshadowing of the feather is complete do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law love is the law love under will";
slba="voidness is s'lba aossic-bel-aossic in stance all perfect the shadow of sleep like a mist in the void casts off images which are known as its dreaming if a man has wealth on waking he has not necessarily wealth in dreaming the manifestation of power on a particular plane depends on the quality of awareness on that plane the fusion of planes constitutes s'lba the perpetual bliss impossible of attainment being ever in the process of becoming the becoming of s'lba is beyond all conditions being the eternal harmony existent between s'lba and aos there is nought without s'lba nothing exists nothing does not exist nothing alone is all it can know for in its selfhood is its knowing speculation about origins creation and similar fancies can not concern s'lba for it ever was not this which was not could not have developed thus and if it will not be that which it will not be also is not for s'lba being finite would be infinitely small to an extreme non-existent to seek reason for s'lba betrays fear of it s'lba is not it is that which is neither one thing nor another it is all things and nothing for all things include nothing even as no thing excludes conception to pursue enquiries into realms wherein s'lba moves is futile s'lba does not move that alone moves which s'lba sheds in a self-made vapour s'lba shines in a web of words non-relative to s'lba flounders the self unfound in swamps of delusion and in dread of not-self not-self which is non-existent men have worshipped as god this not-self concept arising from s'lba unrevealed is the cause of restriction in activity as in passivity which even so is merely apparent for s'lba remains untouched by the circumference of its circle the circumference which does not exist for not-self is its centre these considerations apply to aossic-sphere in moon-circle man sees 'others' their positions determine his progress being phantoms cast from himself for the sake of observation of memory or for nothing at all man loses self in this confusion he beholds the forms out cast as possessing selves of their own herein lies his misery the measure of his progress and the means of his satisfaction have been thrust against himself and endowed with will the power of which is his own recoiling self-power therefore he who would abide in the purity of s'lba must dissolve all forms in their source which itself must be cleansed of objectivity and dissolved in s'lba to neglect this purging is to live in delusion prey to distortions of s'lba magnified by fear the phantoms born of stagnancy and dread that men adore as gods have now assumed control have drained their vital fires even as a talisman pregnant with a mage's will stands mage itself and terrifies its maker transference of self is all that has occurred and yet how fatuous to lift up power from one point to place it on another learn to move by being still to know by refusing knowledge of that which you desire to know this is the art of s'lba motionless in vibrancy and wonder s'lba is the consciousness in which thought arises it is the substance of thought and that in which thought moves itself remaining ever still s'lba is unrestricted virgin limitless and boundless without purpose lusting after no result remaining ever perfect every moment of its non-becomingness the thoughts which you think i have already thought for the self of which i speak is the self of which you think constant co-heir of your becoming let the word of thy will be the truth of the self the self of yourself identical in essence to the self of my-self appears to differ in manifestation in emanation as water appears as oceans lakes rivers pools and fountains yet at all times remains water so s'lba appears on earth as you as me he she it yet remains forever i earth has been invoked and water earth is the stability of your being air the breath of spirit that steals from the light of s'lba across the seas of your passion know them all as one know them all as states created for and by the self for eternal joy in the contemplation of s'lba on the summits of the mountains of immaculate solitude know them finally as nought why posit purpose for self that which is infinite can have no purpose its very infinity fulfilling all possibilities he that seeks purpose knows not s'lba purposeless because eternal eternal because unborn immortal because undead and for ever inconceivable the universal joke has been announced it is the name of a vision analogous to the realisation of ultimate irrationality through the trance of sorrow which terminates in rapture samadhi it may be it is the realisation by s'lba of the self's non-relation to the shells of its fancy self bears as much or as little relation to its conceptions as a child to its food these conceptions are the means of its growth through stillness its destruction through activity what fool would create a puppet of clay imagine it spoke and obey its commands that fool alone who is unaware of s'lba who is immersed in duality who is inured to folly many teachers have arisen and will again arise within the universe they have been are and will be misunderstood they teach not that man should follow their ways their light their love their liberty their life but his own way his own light his own love his own liberty his own life which s'lba alone to each one grants the self of none i am disintegration of form in madness is proof of your success if the madness is known as not your own let not the fragments obsess penetrate yet deeper and you will glimpse the jewel of s'lba and come not back again this applies to waking states the realms wherein the self-in-delusion in confused upheaval 'midst the excrement of personality has erected the fantasy of systems madness relates only to these selfmade restrictions madness is a state of mind so is death death is but an event in the waking state no one can dream his own death who dreams it like death madness is ever becoming ever changing elusive ecstatic there is no death but there is release of mind from follies against s'lba deficiency of mind also has no bearing on s'lba back of all beyond conception immaculate it has been wisely said consciousness is a disease of mind phases of consciousness more subtle in dreams sometimes achieve non-consciousness with fleeting dissolution into cosmic samadhi into reality encountering s'lba in direct awareness why should s'lba endeavour to veil herself in a process of delusive progression in the explosion of bliss that ensues upon rapture the self casts off phantoms imbued with its fervour they objectify and are prone to obsess but their rejection ensures continuity of bliss these phantoms swiftly disperse and in an aeon may be in a moment or even in no time the qliphoth dissolve as endless emanations are cast off by the self turn not from bliss to contemplate these forms for they are potent at the instant of their birth even more powerful do they appear in the void of exhaustion new they appear and seemingly alien arrayed in the costumes of dream insidious too are their brilliant reflections partaking finitely of the essence of s'lba they pretend to infinity endlessly perfect he who heeds these shadows of s'lba goes in danger of obsession by the children of isis so poised in s'lba all-embracing let not the images obsess for they are dead at the moment of conception mere shells reverberant shards of the shadow they are past impossible of resurrection forgotten they have never existed in the silence of darkness they are not in the pleasure of s'lba they never appeared thus extricate self from the tangle of thought think not for there is but self to think and to think upon yet no thought of self is possible all that you can ever imagine constitutes self which has no image beyond s'lba and that is voidness in dealings with self on the plane of active manifestation certain laws prevail since s'lba is infinite eternal and unmanifest at any time except in delusion concepts such as hope faith despair motive are meaningless being creations of self in the plane of existence self manifests in waking life for no reason that falls within the range of human calculation s'lba manifests because it is in the nature of itself to become that which it is not by a process of consciousness embracing alternative phases of sentience such as pleasure and pain in the levels of waking the self performs with power applied to the level of sleep this statement could have no meaning since s'lba is ever present and there is no place where she is not from waking levels her play unfolds to guard against the undermind and minds unstable which hold one set of concepts false another true and yet another absolute adhere to the following course abide alone in places of selfhood even in cities remain alone if worlds dissolve see that they merge in you for the rivers of their dissolution are a living light which is the outer robe of s'lba-bel-aossic thus profoundly sleeping in this light select one image of bel as a symbol of your force as zos has shown the thumb is one such image concentrate upon it in the glint of moonlight on a thumbnail the shades will mass then refinement of shadow and a lightening mist ultimately lost as those glorious ones the eye will droop in sleep the lid falling with a hollow click the lid of an empty coffin for osiris is without and the children of isis return herein indeed is a new sexuality but he who has not bel-aossic attained comprehends it not in the full of the moon beneath eaves of darkness catch the gleam of light on the nail of the thumb the stars flicker and go out the moon appears and vanishes like a crazy leaper of the backward paths s'lba alone abides you are become the primal power of the new thumb-phallic splendour in your identity therewith is bel-aossic perfect shadowed forth in form as the sigil of s'lba these words flashed before me in the cavern of initiation in the transference of consciousness to the thumb of bel self reveals its primal power from the destruction of mind that gives birth to chaos a zone of mauve is created a desert of sand above the tunnels of set the winds hurry through them a sinister piping bearing the beetle on its wings the thumb is force the pipe of pan the phallus of set the heart of aossic it is all these and more for these are shadows it is the tube of teitan through which leaps the fire the hair of nuit through which shrieks the god the flame that is s'lba on the summit of annihilation the wind that cools her mass in the temple of nu isis dream not vaguely of nebulous heavens or hells or births into god-state or forgiveness of 'sins' know the now in the fire of becoming of the ecstasy eternal that flows from s'lba when mind has been hurled to abysmal destruction know the self that at all times can be not other than itself that can know no state because it is wholeness holiness beauty the state bel-aossic is primary sexless man must seek inward and pierce the deep centre unveil the shrine of his desire and rouse the vague spectres of the backward darkness in his progress he has transcended many karmas with wings he has believed himself endowed as he was long aeons since he has wings now and horns he shall have more if he invokes the backward darkness this is known in zos kia zone let him embody his desire in symbol passionless in a glyph suggesting a concept without evoking its form let him embody the ecstasy of self by thumb-concentration until his mind is exhausted at this moment should the sigil be released into the darkness of the unexpected should it be cast into the outer darkness with dazzling swiftness in the act of departure until he is lost in reverberant silence he should not release it for if there is sound the self will not stir silence is the foundation of the work not mere cessation of sound but the outer silence born of nu isis that thrills in the darkness on power-waves of s'lba this silence is the base of the work from it arises a thin snake of light it ascends the spine as an arrow in its swift consummation in the zone of aossic the sigil becomes fulfilment of desire ensues upon drinking the colours of isis in the desert of set at the time of the hell-bird should the thumb wrench as a claw in a panic of frenzy should the fire-tongue leap from the teeth of darkness persist yet in the working abiding unmoved by pleasure or pain by this oft-repeated achieve the exhaustion which enables the self to project its desire to the root of becoming to the base of that which desires nought thus does self descend into bel uniting that which is impossible to that which has not yet occurred thus does aossic remain ever perfect supposing a bel that fulfils its becoming by means of its rapture for delight is the seal of its perfection this wisdom of s'lba contains the pattern of self in non-mobile becoming the hand in action controlled by the thumb in trance-state all-perfect has drawn these sigils embodied therein are the karmas of self in reversion s'lba is beyond definition but she is not beyond expression in linear form all art is her yantra on levels of action she appears as a system of sigils bereft of terrestrial significance from a source impossible of location and ultimately irrational on levels of reason does the same apply for reason establishes in waking state the impossibility of knowing s'lba she is therefore ever virgin yet from s'lba proceed these sigils shed in the lightnings of her bliss from this point does the line proceed as the wine of sex arises from the fountain of hecate the thumb all-powerful plies the stroke while within the perfumes of s'lba announce the kalas of change the movement of that metabasis incarnates in the line as a deeply moving current in the wine the silence culminating in ecstasy beyond manifests not for form may not match its wonder even as the line flows purposeless pure so flows the word that its movement evokes vibrating on the lips of the i-mage within the temple of bel should that word at last explode a star would fly the skies and fall ever earthward no more the very self attained the bel splits asunder and flares again the awful fire in elder aeons should the word burst forth he that heard it would flame at the last in glory a winged spout of fire engulfed in outer darkness he would return not again he would be not again was he ever in the process of becoming s'lba exists alone and self exists not but to become that purity purposeless and free that is the fulfilling of itself in the realm of aossic go forth and know as you go that none goes with you for you are all my holy shining one all and none in ilyarun-bel-aos whose abode is beyond the mauve zone the self in progression is forever unmanifest a series of not-selves in ceaseless becoming this self that is not-self is aossic-bel-s'lba the state of before-time that had no existence dormant in bliss is this way content in its notness in timeless perfection this is state primal the plane of aossic wherefrom that old one flies forward to no thing each flight a 'self each way a return never there but always here concentrate awareness at the root of the thumb swiftly streams the force along the shaft of will falter not hold fast until in the mauve mist the whirling noughts pulsate this chaos vanishes the mist alone remains and a differenceless crimson ocean from which uprears the tower of koth silent sentinel against the vortex of negation massing in the tower are the spectres of awareness removed is the self from the seat of its function yet it has not moved albeit you have fused with that that is not-thou yet is it i as much as thou at this moment of meditation the mind breaks open the tower crumbles its dust falls like brittle beetles silkily into the abyss falling falling falling man has so fallen bel-aossic moves aossic moves not withdraw slowly awareness from the symbol of power subtly stealthily bridge the parapet of spiderweb spanning the nightblack gulf strange masks float dankly about you glowing in death's magnetic sleep identify not remain immaculate the pageant will pass mistake not the masks one or another one for another for they are your death masks yet are they faceless like the god with black paws this is the moment of precipitous obsession hold firmly the shaft of extended will so that desire blossoms not in belief as counselled by zos this meditation has no purpose beyond awareness of s'lba in the state of bel-aos for in aossic it is ever known in bel-aossic it is known only when particles of self emerge in isolated spectres then is destroyed the concept dualistic in shattering lightnings the points of night expire one star remains one truth only naught remains your self that point dissolves yet are you still the self alone abides unmoving it absorbs nought it emanates nought for nought in it abides not but to become the impossible as to wakeful workings sexuality has made you crave the impossible for you crave that which you are not would you attain to the silence of s'lba observe and be still self implies not-self man implies not-man not-man appears as woman as male implies female sex embraces these concepts all as zos has shown androgyne is concept perfect obtaining wholeness in all states because it resolves the illusion of duality but the androgyne in s'lba-zone is not-perfect and implies the not-man as the shadow from outside woman embraces it thus is she the gateway between the stars she achieves ilyarun-bel-aossic beyond sex beyond mind beyond the clouds of terrestrial consciousness reason too is false being but the base of the terrestrial triangle bel-aos has the hand the thumb the eye and the mouth the phallus is concealed in the point of light the centre of a circle swirled in night eternal the heart of a dark star invisible from earth yoni is embodied in symbols stellar-splendid a star built inwards rotating on its molten core it grips the yod and feeds the vampire flame a state of neither is born the child knows not itself for it is ever coming it attains awareness in the process of becoming the not-human that cannot speak its name cannot utter its word the liberated force is irreversible and impossible of reabsorption into that which sent it forth it is the first and the last whirling before the coming of lam's egg the soundless hum the cry of the whippoorwill the egg circulates in space the ring-pass-not beyond which vision fails beyond the rim of that vision the children of isis revolve no woman is needed for this attainment if woman is understood she is an entrance to the outer places and their outrance from the egg bursts forth a cry not the cry of any known aethyr and a spiral call it echoes in the voids of vith and secretes a meticulous globule which flowers into a myriad globes the bubbles that chatter in the sigil of the master this conception arises from the friction of movement created by s'lba in her brilliance immobile and within the self the egg seethes until there emerges an insect whose drone is known the master once shaped it for meditation from the base mound of the thumb from its twin globules in upsurging spirals flows bel-aos but desire not consummation for in desiring an object man becomes it man can have no image of this attainment undisturbed by desire rejecting desire perceive that which desire conceals perceive the self cut sheer from conception all is the word and the self is nought in the still silence know that to know the self is to know all and nothing for the self is neither and beyond them both in non-mobile becoming it has been decreed let the temple be cleansed let the false gods be cast out all gods being conceptions of self are true they come to life in moments of exhaustion but times arrive when temples crumble idols fall and i alone remain the dust of the old ones shall dance again in the writhing wind brilliant with space-frozen flame the formless again will form the sleeping again shall awaken you will sleep on the column of flame will you be borne to the titanic island amidst storm skywreck snow foam and sea blood you will unite the gold and the mauve the lama will leave his throne the thumb will tremble and the eye spout fire but lessen not the flight be gloriously lost you are becoming this is the hour the double power invoke now by the sign of aossic destroy not neither create within the nightmind alone desire attains aossic realise that self is all and worship all for by robing self in diversity pleasure is achieved in a love beyond compare desire nought and all will be yours desire for either implies non-attainment of the vision of s'lba to become is all that you can ever do set each idea against its opposite and in their abolition know reason as confusion by the nature of its being it is because balanced its balance is maintained by ideas antagonistic conceptions ever rising from the causes of their conflict disintegration of form in madness is the victory achieved by the ravens of dispersion pierce yet deeper until the very walls of mind crumble and fall within that gulf s'lba pleasures alone and inviolate you cannot but become to remain at one with the source of thought assume not the masks this is the first step it is also the last aossic attained through non-mobile becoming yields the knowledge of impossibility and the key to the sphere of non-necessity the realisation of pleasure in explosion of self as black eagle instructed the zos in the book of that name your powers are incalculably vaster than anything imagined you have imagined s'lba for s'lba cannot be known thumb eye mouth hand these are the magical keys and the mystical mode of opening the gateway is formulated by zos in a secret glyph guarded by the shade of a water-witch open the gate and call to the wind the backward darkness will respond the call breeds a slime like a luminous fungus that will adhere to the gateway a curious insect will hover and attract by its buzzing more of its kind they are simulacra of the beetles known yet unknown to the master and to the lama strive not to net them they are outposts of qliphoth-breed forerunners of the children of isis they spin strange threads like the spiders of besqul but they are not spiders and the lines they trace have no affinity with the vevers of the violent ones who feed upon flesh and know not the subtleties of s'lba the lines lead below as it is written there are thrones under ground and the monarchs upon them reign over space and beyond invoke them in darkness outside the circles of time in silence in sleep in conjurations of chaos the deep will respond as the eye bleeds its tears the mouth its blood so also the egg of lam in slime encased releases the these spectres are harmless but their blood is devastating imbibe it slowly before its luminosity altogether dims they are the stealers of your force within the waking world they cannot dream turn within let not the blood emerge but constrain the thumb until the night of isis falls uncertain is all else obsession lurks without within all is calm for all has been surpassed is not is the residue of bliss upon the parapet of vith now assume pose bel-aossic symbolizing s'lba the state of becoming resulting from awareness the clenched claw upon the head the left claw at the place of power thumb erect this is the posture supreme the posture of self in the bliss of becoming let a minute pass another soon if rightly flexed muscles bound head back pressed pulse athrob exhaustion supervenes the earth your bed the sky your dreams in magical sleep proceed with caution aossic alone must be within you his sigil glows like the pyramid of vith sink in the great within where the deep ones dream in seaweed-tangled sleep a circle of light revolves about you it is the circle in the sigil of aossic pregnant with the brood of isis observe the lengthening tower leaning away from the gulf they are the i and the o separating in objectivity the basilisk spirals aossic-esses hissing ixaxaar now the moon appears new an argent sickle beyond its curve lies no thing annihilation absorption in the light of ilyarun this sigil is remembered in the bliss of non-mobile becoming it flashes from darkness to darkness the darkness that is undying that is more brilliant than ra-thek this sigil seals the outer sphere of mauve known only in the secret love of s'lba iba";
