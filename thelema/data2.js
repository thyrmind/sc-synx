liberccccxviii=`﻿i am in a vast crystal cube in the form of the great god
harpocrates this cube is surrounded by a sphere about me are
four archangels in black robes their wings and armour lined out
in white
in the north is a book on whose back and front are ambz
in enochian characters
within it is written
i am the surrounding of the four
lift up your heads o houses of eternity for my father
goeth forth to judge the world one light let it become a
thousand and one sword ten thousand that no man hide him from
my father's eye in the day of judgment of my god let the gods
hide themselves let the angels be troubled and flee away for the
eye of my father is open and the book of the æons is fallen
arise arise arise let the light of the sight of time be
extinguished let the darkness cover all things for my father goeth
forth to seek a spouse to replace her who is fallen and defiled
seal the book with the seals of the stars concealed for the
rivers have rushed together and the name hwhy is broken in a
thousand pieces (against the cubic stone)
tremble ye o pillars of the universe for eternity is in
travail of a terrible child she shall bring forth an universe of
darkness whence shall leap forth a spark that shall put his father
to flight
the obelisks are broken the stars have rushed together the
light hath plunged into the abyss the heavens are mixed with
hell
my father shall not hear their noise his ears are closed
his eyes are covered with the clouds of night
the end the end the end for the eye of shiva he hath
opened the universe is naked before him for the æon of saturn
leaneth toward the bosom of death
the angel of the east hath a book of red written in letters of
blue abfma in enochian the book grows before my eyes
and filleth the whole heaven
within it is written thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
i see above the book a multitude of white-robed ones from
whom droppeth a great rain of blood but above them is a golden
sun having an eye whence a great light
i turned me to the south and read therein
seal up the book speak not that which thou seest and reveal
it unto none for the ear is not framed that shall hear it nor the
tongue that can speak it
o lord god blessed blessed blessed be thou for ever
thy shadow is as great light
thy name is as the breath of love across all worlds
rend your garments o ye clouds uncover yourselves for
the love of my son
who are they that trouble thee
who are they that slew thee
o light come thou who art joined with me to bruise the
dragon's head
we who are wedded and the earth perceiveth it not
o that our bed were seen of men that they might rejoice in
my fertility that my sister might partake of my great light
o light of god when wilt thou find the heart of man—write
not i would not that men know the sorrow of my heart amen
i turned me to the west and the archangel bore a flaming
book on which was written an in enochian within was drawn
a fiery scorpion yet cold withal
until the book of the east be opened
until the hour sound
until the voice vibrate
until it pierce my depth
look not on high
look not beneath
for thou wilt find a life which is as death or a death which
should be infinite
for thou art submitted to the four five thou shalt find but
seven is lone and far
o lord god let thy spirit hither unto me
for i am lost in the night of infinite pain no hope no god
no resurrection no end i fall i fear
o saviour of the world bruise thou my head with thy foot
to save the world that once again i touch him whom i slew that
in my death i feel the radiance and the heat of the moving of thy
robes
let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of
nazareth
go go
if i keep silence—or if i speak each word is anguish without
hope
and i heard the æthyr cry aloud return return return
for the work is ended and the book is shut and let the glory be
to god the blessed for ever in the æons amen thus far is the
voice of tex and no more
the sky appears covered with stars of gold the background is
of green but the impression is also of darkness
an immense eagle-angel is before me his wings seem to hide
all the heaven
he cried aloud saying the voice of the lord upon the
waters the terror of god upon mankind the voice of the lord
maketh the skies to tremble the stars are troubled the aires fall
the first voice speaketh and saith cursed cursed be the earth
for her iniquity is great oh lord let thy mercy be lost in the
great deep open thine eyes of flame and light o god upon
the wicked lighten thine eyes the clamour of thy voice let
it smite down the mountains
let us not see it cover we our eyes lest we see the end of
man
close we our ears lest we hear the cry of woman
let none speak of it let none write it i i am troubled my
eyes are moist with dews of terror surely the bitterness of death
is past
and i turned me to the south and lo a great lion as wounded
and perplexed
he cried i have conquered let the sons of earth keep
silence for my name is become as that of death
when will men learn the mysteries of creation
how much more those of the dissolution (and the pang of
fire)
i turned me to the west and there was a great bull white
with horns of white and black and gold his mouth was scarlet
and his eyes as sapphire stones with a great sword he shore the
skies asunder and amid the silver flashes of the steel grew
lightnings and deep clouds of indigo
he spake it is finished my mother hath unveiled herself
my sister hath violated herself the life of things hath
disclosed its mystery
the work of the moon is done motion is ended for ever
clipped are the eagle's wings but my shoulders have not lost
their strength
i heard a great voice from above crying thou liest for the
volatile hath indeed fixed itself but it hath arisen above thy sight
the world is desert but the abodes of the house of my father
are peopled and his throne is crusted over with white brilliant
stars a lustre of bright gems
in the north is a man upon a great horse having a scourge
and balances in his hand (or a long spear glitters at his back or in
his hand) he is clothed in black velvet and his face is stern and
terrible
he spake saying i have judged it is the end the gate of the
beginning look in the beneath and thou shalt see a new world
i looked and saw a great abyss and a dark funnel of whirling
waters or fixed airs wherein were cities and monsters and trees
and atoms and mountains and little flames (being souls) and all
the material of an universe
and all are sucked down one by one as necessity hath
ordained for below is a glittering jewelled globe of gold and
azure set in a world of stars
and there came a voice from the abyss saying thou seest
the current of destiny canst thou change one atom in its path
i am destiny dost thou think to control me for who can move
my course
and there falleth a thunderbolt therein a catastrophe of
explosion and all is shattered and i saw above me a vast arm
reach down dark and terrible and a voice cried i am
eternity
and a great mingled cry arose no no no all is
changed all is confounded naught is ordered the white is stained
with blood the black is kissed of the christ return return it
is a new chaos that thou findest here chaos for thee for us it is
the skeleton of a new truth
i said tell me this truth for i have conjured ye by the
mighty names of god the which ye cannot but obey
the voice said
light is consumed as a child in the womb of its mother to
develop itself anew but pain and sorrow infinite and darkness
are invoked for this child riseth up within his mother and doth
crucify himself within her bosom he extendeth his arms in the
arms of his mother and the light becometh fivefold*
lux in luce
christus in cruce
deo duce
sempiterno
and be the glory for ever and ever unto the most high god
amen
then i returned within my body giving glory unto the lord
of light and of the darkness in sæcula sæculorum amen`
libercdxv=`this is document c in the account of the progress of nemo to to meta therion
this is the preliminary account of this operation of magick art
sol in libra an ix 1913 fra osv anon note ol sonuf vaoresagi = i reign over ye in enochian crowley's motto as 5○=6□ accomplished the task laid upon him by the great white brotherhood by issuing no x of vol i of the equinox thereby he being brought to the end of his resources he bethought himself to pray unto the great gods of heaven that they would bestow favour upon him – for even as did job he cursed not god at all – that he might make a new sacrifice unto the magnum opus
now there appeared fra lampada tradamvictor neuburg having passed through the ordeal of a neophyte to undertake the task of a zelator as by his oath bound also for months 18 had fra osv been initiated by fra mtheodore reuss into the greater mysteries and been by him induced into the throne of the order of the temple
moreover it is fitting to reconstitute this orderoto in its splendour for at the entry of sol into aries an x is the 600th anniversary of the martyrdom of jbmjacobus burgundius molensis also a casual invocation of pan by these brethren had produced a great marvel
all these things therefore tending thereto let us take up the work with piety and zeal and in holy charity and great chastity of body and soul amen
thus therefore to the glory of the ineffable one of the dove and of the serpent did these two brethren begin their working – first from 455 to 535 did i confess myself even i frater osv 6○ = 5□ receiving the sacrament from a certain priest abart-bachelor walter duranty and being thereby much comforted did i set myself to the painting of the prime pantacle of this book
therein busied came inspiration unto me from the most high and this is the consideration that though pan be the master of this work yet is the work naught without wisdom divine and that hermes is rightly the god of this particular operation of magick art therefore say i let hermes first be invoked and that by the rite and by this incantation which i made with my friend the art-bachelor wd
jungitur en vati vates rex inclyte rabdon hermes tu venias verba nefanda ferens aprox jointly the bard in the bard o famous king of the wand hermes mayest thou come bearing unspeakable words
the first working
wednesday dec 31 1913 ev
at 1140 therefore did i duly open the temple invoking also thoth by the egyptian formulae and upon the stroke of midnight did the first words and acts of the accendat strike on the akasa then immediately did mercury manifest in his first form as it is written in liber ararita i 8 thou hast appeared to me as a young boy mischievous and lovely with thy winged globe and its serpents set upon a staff astrally the temple was full of thousands of flashing caducei of gold and yellow the serpents alive and moving hermes bearing them but so young and so mischievous was he that the sacrifice a sexual actwas impossible this also we learnt that at the accendat the ceremony is to be forgotten altogether and to be resumed with equal suddenness at the first word of the mantra or versicle and the excellence of this control is the agent evoking
then closed the temple at 140 am die joviis thinking to renew the rite in the evening in the hope of obtaining hermes in his next phase
and blessing and worship to the holy one the lord of the serpent and the dove amen
the second working
this next invocation of mercury was done with a new-made image of the god in the east a terminal phallic figure in yellow wax very beautiful made that day by fra osv he also used these invocations at the limits of the night and this o light in light before the majesty of godhead the temple was opened at 1120 pm on the first day of the vulgar year the versicle began at 1140 and ended at 1155 circa immediately fra lt completely lost control although a man of some education degraded himself and dispersed the holy invoked prana by defacing this volume with the meaningless scrawls opposite weh note not available declaring them to be the inspiration of thoth which were unworthy even of his ape in this way a great part of the virtue of the rite was lost some results were however obtained and these were recorded in the esoteric account of this working the temple was closed at about 2 o'clock of the fore-noon of friday
the esoteric record of the second working
the god hermes having been invoked according to the secret rites as elsewhere recorded frater lt proceeded to answer the demands as follows
q osv are we working right
a lt no
q what's wrong
a the time and to a less extent the place
q what is the right time
a three hours before dawn
q does this apply to mercury alone or to all the gods
a to mercury alone
q are we to invoke mercury again
a yes
q tomorrow
a no
q when then
a on the day of the full moon
q what god shall we invoke tomorrow
a thoth
q but thoth is mercury
a you will get another aspect
q shall we not use the same versicle
a it does not matter
q shall i make statues of all the gods
a no
q shall i make tablets of all the gods
a yes
q plain tablets with the versicles
a no
q what tablets
a tablets with the names only
q in what order shall we invoke the gods
a the proper order is – venus mercury juppiter luna sol
q will he help in geomancy
a yes
q and also in the conduct of affairs
a in some not in all
q in business
a in some business
q what
a books money love
q how can we invoke mercury better
a use a golden pentagram placing the same in a prominent position drink yellow wine and eat fish before the ceremony let the clock be removed
q can you suggest any improvements in the ceremonies especially that of juppiter
a scarlet and silver should be worn and the crown osv lt is to wear the scarlet robe violets are to be strewn and trodden with bare feet
q give a distinct proof of your presence appreciable by the intelligence of osv
a let the wand or one become nine this is the sign of priapus but afterwards nothing
osv i understand and agree the proof
lt shall i let him take full possession now
osv yes
lt i am going………yes what do you want to know now there are other things i can tell or else ask me questions
osv tell
lt you will receive good news in respect of money on the eleventh of january in the forenoon fra lt will be concerned with it it will be quite unexpected money will be given by someone to whom lt introduced osv a change in osv's affairs in february
osv i am going to ask a very important question concentrate hard ncgmhd this question enquies as to when the speaker shall attain the grade of magus
lt lp l is 50 and p is 6
osv 56 what
lt i don't know…wait…hours i am not quite sure but it is connected with time
lt the ceremonies should be done every other night
the fratre then changed functions
osv the god has appeared to me in his character as a messenger but as a robust adult rather than a slim youth he has the winged helmet and sandals and bears a caduceus of gold frater lt confirms this description in every respect
osv hear the words which i bear through the ambient air the father of all hath girt himself with a many-coloured robe the father of all hath spilt his seed on galaxy and globe the formation of nebulae is like the bursting of the seed pods of flowers these are not his words but it is his meaning i can't get his words at all what we call light he calls wind our highest spiritual experiences are what he calls light that is why one gets the phenomenon of the opalescent universe so to call it in the sacrament of the ninth degree it is most important… never mind about that all this is the key to the meaning of the latin invocation in the vision of the universal mercury which i have never understood memo obtain a copy and confirm this we shall shortly be given someone who will be of great help to us in our working
lt now wished to ask questions
lt when will the reconciliation of which i am thinking take place
osv there is no real enmity it is a mere tiff or misunderstanding
lt when will the pressure of which i am thinking be relieved
osv the answer to both these questions is death but i don't know in what sense
lt will the most important prediction of december be fulfilled
osv better than you think
lt when
osv it is imminent
lt conventionally
osv like the sword of damocles it impends always but may never fall the answer however that i get is three months
lt satisfactory
osv i haven't got that… i want to lie here and see mercury it seems that hermes is my particular deity at present the golden sparks of which the universe is composed are shot with silver lightnings in his next aspect he should reveal to us a great deal of the inner meaning of this particular rite
in the beginning was the word the logos who is mercury and is therefore to be identified with christ both are messengers their birth-mysteries are similar the pranks of their childhood are similar in the vision of the universal mercury hermes is seen descending upon the sea which refers to mary the crucifixion represents the caduceus the two thieves the two serpents the cliff in the vision of the universal mercury is golgotha maria is simply maia with the solar r in her womb the controversy about christ between the synoptics and john was really a contention between the priests of bacchus sol and osiris also perhaps of adonis and attis on the one hand and those of hermes on the other at that period when initiates all over the world found it necessary owing to the growth of the roman empire and the opening up of means of communication to replace conflicting polytheisms by a synthetic faith this is absolutely new to me this conception of christ as mercury some difficulty about the …this sentence is now quite unintelligible
to continue the identification compare christ's descent into hell with the function of hermes as guide of the dead also hermes leading up eurydice and christ raising up jairus' daughter christ is said to have risen on the third day because it takes three days for the planet mercury to become visible after separating from the orb of the sun it may be noted here that mercury and venus are the planets between us and the sun as if the mother and the son were mediators between us and the father
note christ as the healer and also his own expression the son of man cometh as a thief in the night and also this scripture matthew xxiv 24-7 for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall the coming of the son of man be
note also christ's relations with the money-changers his frequent parables and the fact that his first disciple was a publican
note also mercury as the deliverer of prometheus
one half of the fish symbol is also common to christ and mercury fish are sacred to mercury owing presumably to their quality of movement and cold-bloodedness many of christ's disciples were fishermen and he was always doing miracles in connection with fish
note also christ as the mediator no man cometh unto the father but by me and mercury as chokmah through whom alone we can approach kether
the caduceus contains a complete symbol of the gnosis the winged sun or phallus represents the joy of life on all planes from the lowest to the highest the serpents besides being active and passive horus and osiris and all their other well known attributions are those qualities of eagle and lion respectively of which we know but do not speak it is the symbol which unites the microcosm and the macrocosm the symbol of the magical operation which accomplishes this the caduceus is life itself and of universal application it is the universal solvent it is quite easy to turn quicksilver into gold on the physical plane and this will soon be done new life will flow through the world in consequence the god now lays his caduceus upon my lips for silence bidding me only remember that on the following night he is to come in another form
the temple was then closed promises to pay – have quite replaced gold
written out from 1245 – 230 pm 2114
the third working
friday jan 2 1914 ev
the temple was opened at about midnight the clock had been purposely removed at 1227 am die saturni the quia patris was ended during the versicle fra osv approached the state of ecstatic possession seeing the triple cross of the grand hierophants and then hermes himself comprehending also that the t… t… b… were the twin serpents that writhe upon his wand but mastering the tendency the versicle was quietly concluded
a great deal of information and counsel was thus obtained the full account of which is in the esoteric record
the temple was closed at 215 am
in the morning the suggestion of osv that lt should arise move and appear to transcribe the record led to two fine fights a sign of the excess of magical force developed during the previous day the art-bachelor wd came with what may prove to be good news of two matters both of a juppiterian nature also came a letter promising a valuable introduction
the esoteric record of the third working
die saturni 158 am hermes as force
lt he is essentially phallic but he has a book in his hand the book ii which has 106 pp on the last page as a colophon is a four-pointed star very luminous and this is to be identified with the eve of shiva and the book pertains to the grade of 7degree = 4square the sub-title of the book is bia which is said to mean 'force'
every drop of semen which hermes sheds is a world the technical term for this semen is kratos those worlds are held in chains but invisibly people upon the worlds are like maggots upon an apple – all forms of life bred by the worlds are in the nature of parasites pure worlds are flaming globes each a conscious being number of worlds ejected 7482135
the name of this phallus is thoth hermes or ma ma is the god who seduced the phallus away from the yoni hence the physical universe all worlds are excreta they represent wasted semen therefore all is blasphemy this explains why man made god in his own image
the feminine side of ma is pan which explains why pan is a devil the only way to be really born is by annihilation – to be born into chaos where pan is the saviour
i may say no more because the process is secret
with regard to genesis when adam died heva became masculine in order to escape the temptations of the serpent but she failed her failure cut the serpent in two hence the caduceus because if there were only one serpent hermes could not be the messenger of the gods it is the quality of this serpent business that gives him power to travel this again is blasphemy but lawful because the law of the jews is founded upon it
it is the fixed mercury of which the physical form of the god is made this fixed mercury is the result of the mind
semen itself is mercury the river of life flowing throughout the generations that is fluid mercury what is from the point of view of life waste is knowledge hence the opposition between knowledge and life one is homo- and the other hetero-sexuality those are reconciled in mercury who is wisdom
osv i am making a silent prayer to the god and thanksgiving you can get magic force from either women or men but to use the former is more dangerous to the career of the magician and there is the danger of impregnation which however can be guarded against in the obvious way
in order to get this god more perfectly a cock should be slain in his honour and the blood drunk as a sacrament the throat of the cock should be cut over the great image that is upon the altar the image should be placed in a vessel so as to catch the blood
he should be invoked on 8 consecutive nights beginning with wednesday he says we should feed in greater abundance he will protect us there is a gate to knock down between us and mastery of the universe and frater lt has a fault which is introspection the point is that he is a man of thought rather than of action osv has also faults his chief fault is contradiction whenever he gets into a state of hopelessness he may renew his strength by this rite and this will be good for alwaysit is remarkable that this actually occurred in may 1915 and july 1916 ev osv had forgotten the divine injunction but the sudden change from dryness to herbility was extremely well marked om
the nature of this god is to go blindly ahead the semen that he sheds is kether and not his own he is only responsible for ejecting it and he cares nothing what may come to it he despises intensely all these correspondences identifications and the like he despises intelligence for he is the supreme wisdom so fully in accord with destiny that interpretation is beneath him if we need pure magical force he is to be invoked he says that tomorrow night we are to ask questions by geomancy without doing any rite we are to invoke juppiter on monday had it not been that we first invoked him we could not invoke juppiter successfully we shall probably have to invoke juppiter for 4 nights running reaching a climax on thursday we shall get not so much information as aid from juppiter it is very important to have banquets
lt will he help to this end
osv he doesn't know and doesn't care
he says don't be such an ass as to think how you are going to do a thing just do it the man in the parable who counted the cost had the slave-spirit he also says that in the rites of luna and venus osv should have a woman in that of luna a menstruating woman he refuses to tell me when i am to have this woman he says it is a question of common sense he says do it don't ask me about it
i am now lost in contemplation of him in his great aspect of vehicle of the energy of the highest he is that which fertilizes the luminiferous ether the strain in it that produces what is called matter
he is the creative energy of the artist in particular and one should invoke him unless one wants the  an holy act before the world this was done at the house of the lay-sister jc the art-bachelor wd was the victim 'drawing-room songs of apollo'
i see it all now the virile force of mars is far beneath him all of the other gods are merely aspects of juppiter formulated by hermes he is the first of the aeons he wants us not to invoke the other forms of mercury he says that we have more knowledge than we know what to do with julius caesar did not know the qabalah but he did better than the pair of you in the matter of husbands and wives he moreover subdued gaul and germany and would not have been killed if he had not gone to a talking shop
i am praying him to fill us with magick force for this invocation of juppiter
he says it depends principally upon the banquets this is the great preparation to make and he says what fools to bother about the room you don't think i am in the room do you he wants us to overcome shame generally and says there is no shame about me is there
he suggests an obvious method which i blush to repeat
the sense of humour of this god is very strong he is not sentimental about his principal function he regards the universe as an excellent practical joke yet he recognizes that juppiter is serious and the universe is serious although he laughs at them for being serious his sole business is to transmit the force from juppiter and he is concerned with nothing else the message is life but in juppiter the life is latent he says that we can do everything if we will only act as he does
he again exhibits his contempt for the art of conversation by making a suggestion with which owing to the lateness of the hour we comply only in symbolic form
215 am
the fourth working
monday jan 5 1914 ev
it now appears to osv that the suggestion made by hermes of a further sacrifice was meant to be obeyed the attempt to replace the real thing by its symbol led to a osv having a bad cold which confined him to his bed b the continued ill-temper of lt © the breaking up of the rendezvous proposed in the letter d the complete cessation of good news however this afternoon die lunae did the frater lt sacrifice to the glory of hermes and may he restore us to favour and help in the work of juppiteranon note crowley used a double pp in juppiter for homosexual workings whom therefore let us invoke by the secret rite and this holy versicle
haud secus ac puerum spumanti semini vates
lustrat dum gaudens accipit alter aquas
sparge precor servis hominum rex atque deorum
juppiter omnipotens aurea dona tuis
900
this then was done duly though with maimed rites owing to osv's malady yet did he take the function of priest the brethren remained conversing from 10 pm when the temple was closed until about 1 am die martiis when lt beholding juppiter saw this verse
via est hodie nomina sanctissimorum in felicitate habent viam
deus dedit signum in via
the way is today the names of the most holy in felicity have the way
god gave a sign in the way
the fifth working
tuesday jan 6 1914 ev
the temple was opened at about 930 the rite performed ut ordinatur and the closing accomplished by 1030
deus adest fatur sparge verba opus fiat hodie est verbum in nomine dei cras est opus et postea o beati qui haec verba noscunt! ergo sum deus hodie aurea dona cras vobis feram accipe dei verba atque vobis bene erit benignus sum in hominum mundo semper deinde phallum ejaculatum tibi feram in nomine patris verbum tibi refert ad fratrem osv patris refert ad fra osv in nomine
god is present he says sprinkle words let the work be done today is the word in the name of god tomorrow is the work and afterwards 'o blessed those who know these words i am god today tomorrow i will bring you the golden gifts' receive the words of god and it will be well with you i am benevolent always in the world of men' then i will bear to you an ejaculating phallus in the name of the father the word refers to brother osv similarly to the father in the name
ps this promise was very amply fulfilled
the sixth working
wednesday jan 7 1914 ev
the temple opened about 9 the rite performed orally by osv and the closing accomplished at 945
osv thinks that lt has failed in due banqueting
the seventh working
thursday jan 8 1914 ev
hitherto so far as we are aware nothing great of the result of the operation of juppiter is obtained yet to-night i feel more confidence than usual i am in a highly nervous or electric state my cold was better and i went for a fairly long walk and dined out am tired excited feverish i think a slight relapse juppiter bring's all to a good end
the temple opened about 1000 the rite being done ut ordinatur we behold a universe of the most brilliant purple with golden stars and juppiter seated on his throne surrounded by the 4 beasts upon thick clouds borne upon a phalanx of eagles in the book lxv chap v we find the passage 9 or 10 – the passage 8-13 subsequently there appeared a great peacock meaning according to fra lt change - journeys - motion - excitement - improvement -  some word unknown lhikmopilv the peacock is now crowned and regards himself in a mirror this word is summarized in breaking ie of all old conditions fra lt connects this with the word of equinox of libra an ix the temple was closed about 1120
received several visitors the art-bachelor wd the fair damosel jcjane cheron and the good knight my brother-in-arms sir lionellionel e kennedy sculptured a sacred phallus till nigh 200 415 am die venerii a wonderful and repeated dream i wake up at last able to get down the truth i have long seen aelfrida tillyard the beloved disciple and one clairbelle lady waloskie figure in it mental images leave no trace when destroyed conservation of matter and energy are not paralleled by thought i had kept on reducing symbols to the lingam and the yoni and thence destroying them much to the expressed wonder and alarm of aet of course the l and y are only convenient standards of reduction the point is that illusions destroyed leave no trace or effect but merely vanish as this process becomes general in one's life it really diminishes one's universe the bourgeois is subconsciously aware that this must result and is therefore right in his own way in refusing to destroy even one illusion and in persecuting those who shatter them also there is only one right path to either side leads not merely off but to the abyss i remember in my dream mimicking the bourgeois a-tiptoe marking time trembling and blind this idea was also presented in many other ways intensely vivid which now i forget moreover as i wake myself thoroughly by writing this note the lens of my intellectual comprehension of the great truth seems to dim and i find myself fearing in the morning i should find the words obscure the destruction of mental images is the only possible annihilation is my dream-idea destroyed mental images leave no trace is close to if not quite the wording my contrast with matter and energy set forth above was a waking rational comment i remember catching up an old felt hat and explaining to aet saraswati the beloved disciple that it was only to be destroyed by first perceiving it as a disguise for the yoni – i think the dream ran thus but much i fail to recapture let me sleep again and may the holy one give again if it be his will to his beloved in sleep!
930 the post has brought 3 things of the nature of juppiter a letter from my lawyers a pot of opium and a love-poem of a religious type chicago may some readers may boggle at the attribution but they are dull
the eighth working
sunday jan 11 1914 ev
sunday jan 11 i saw a most remarkable fulfilment of the prophecy of hermes also 2 other excellent matters have come to fruition further one of the brethren of osv and lt has inherited money which is a great indirect benefit to that cause we have at heart we then invoked hermes and obtained a good result
on monday fra lt was indisposed
on tues the brethren performed 'the mass of the phoenix' in the house of a friend pdf an instruction was moreover given to the fra osv to which he will duly pay heed
on wednesday fra lt being again indisposed osv decided to go on thursday to the forest with him to seek health this they did and by the favour of the gods obtained it now therefore on monday jan 19 according to the counsel and reproof of hermes did they again address themselves to the invocation of juppiter and this is die lunae
the esoteric record of the eighth working
die lunae 1215 am
the god hermes having been invoked osv beheld him in his character of the messenger young bearing the caduceus he stands upon the altar of the east poised upon his right toe he is made of fixed light the colour thereof being pale gold
lampada tradam lifted up his voice and said' what sayeth he
osv i am the messenger of the gods and i send you wreaths
famed among men shall become this thy scripture
lt will it be successful in its object
osv yea verily and amen
the whole method is right but we shall improve in details lt's mental attitude should be more poetic
the mass of the phoenix on tuesday depends entirely on the feeling of mental superiority thus induced
lt is there any message for osv of a personal character
osv he will have news perhaps even tomorrow morning rather startling in character to be included under the general heading of good
lt will lt get news
osv news is coming to him
lt good news
osv soft news like the body of a dove from england
lt are the gods pleased with the ceremonies
osv yea they rejoice exceedingly this rite is to be the mainstay of the work anything can be obtained by this method suitable persons will present themselves for initiation into it women are not to be admitted except in those rites where feminine gods are invoked they must not be admitted to the invocations of male gods
lt what is the immediate task
osv the four-fold invocation of juppiter should have been performed four times this week however it has been interfered with by the mass of the phoenix you will therefore employ it in experiments invoking priapus bacchus mars unless you find suitable women you must be very careful with mars if you invoke him if it is still necessary to invoke juppiter begin on monday four times a week for four weeks but why should it be necessary abramelin squares may be used as versicles this ie quasi instrumentaum gaudii was the use of the child in the abramelin operation respectability is the greatest of all blinds the general key in reading ancient documents of a magical nature is to suspect the worst osv seems to get his fame alright and this will leave him very peaceful
any amount of news coming for both of us but osv has more than lt the news is like parcels of dove's wings of a delicate purple grey or black goose quill there is also news from the west of england from glasgow or its neighbourhood and from america
lt are any officers wanted
osv no no one is to be initiated until after the public orgie……
i am now seeing the purple and grey background as if the force were developing around those clouds flash forth violet rays in the indigo in the centre of all is the golden mercury now he comes forward kissing me on the mouth laying his caduceus on my phallus and he lifted up his voice saying unto all kingdoms shall thou utter the word now he puts his tongue into my mouth it is not like the tongue of a man but of a serpent or an ant-eater he runs it all over my brain making the skull luminous transparent phosphorescent moreover he spake winged words
i will give thee the wisdom the serpent but thou must cleanse thy brain purge thyself in the sun it is the love of others that will purify thee most this needest thou the devotion absolute of men four and women four and all these four men will be deformed and these four women will come from the four quarters of the earth – the four continents whose names begin with a

i see the most wonderful range of mountains with orange clouds of sunrise flaming upon them yet the crest of the mountain curls over as it rolls onward like the crest of a wave with one foot on this crest stands mercury again around him soft flames of orange and green and purple and these words spake he from golden mouth
thou art mine thou comest always unto me always in every grade am i thy guide and even at this hour do i burn up thy dust moreover thou shalt behold a certain earnest of thy work and that right early
this mercury is poised upon a winged wheel that uttereth lightnings he droppeth ostrich plumes for rank and twists of flax to signify that the fate of certain men will be in my hands
i now see a purple planet in space radiating light from a luminous ring and also from its poles
with regard to reincarnation the heliocentric theory is right as we conquer the conditions of a planet we incarnate on the next planet inward until we return to the father of all when our experiences link together become intelligible and star speaks to star terra is the last planet where bodies are made of earth in venus they are fluid on mercury aerial while in the sun they are fashioned of pure fire it is most important to develop the fluid body to pack away all your powers in it he insists on the importance of a pure body instancing frater t'agathon as an example of a failure to do this
i now see the eight-fold star of mercury suddenly blazing out it is composed of four fleur-de-lys with rays like antlers bulrushes in shape between them the central core has the cypher of the grand master but not the one you know upon the cross are the dove the hawk the serpent and the lion also one other symbol yet more secret
now i behold fiery swords of light all this is upon a cosmic scale all the distances are astronomical when i say sword i have a definite consciousness of a weapon many millions of miles in length the field of my vision is as much enlarged as if i had been practising batrachophrhenobookosmomachia for ten years
now follow numerous questions of osv to lt indicated only by initials the same question was asked repeatedly in different forms but always answered in the same sense until the last question
lt i have never seen such a lot of beautiful skyscapes there are pink clouds like flights of birds actually in flight now they are like flying serpents their colours are mingled with purple and green anhalonium visions must be very similar to this
it is all over now
he didn't go on because he had come to tell us things for a particular purpose
the temple was then closed fra lampada tradam was then clairvoyant as he thinks or obsessed as osv thinks and makes the following statement which osv considers demonic on the grounds that many of the statements are contrary to public morality
lt begins by saying that this rite is a huge force that we unloose by the time that we have 20 people working at it it will become very dangerous international complications are to be fearednote that the world-war broke out just 6 months later osv this was the original form of worship it is important not to initiate any persons under the age of 30 unless for some special reason the obvious dangers of the rite appall lt he says that those who adopt this rite will either succeed completely or fail utterly there is no middle path for it is impossible to escape the ring of divine karma created
in any series of rites the roles of the celebrants should not be interchangeable osv is to be priest only in invocations of feminine gods the occult reason for this is that only the black gods are hermaphrodite !!
the exception to this rule is in cases of divine possession
the supreme rite would be to bring about a climax in the death of the victim by this rite one would attain the summit of magical art even better would be to slay a girl preferably a willing victim after violating her she should be cut into 9 piecesweh note see below for crowley's opinion that this portion of the record represents false or grossly defective material from some interfering evil these should not be eaten but divided as follows – head arms legs and quadrisected trunk the names of the gods appropriate are to be written on the skin the arms are then to be flayed and burnt in honour of pan or vesta the legs treated in the same manner should be offered to priapus hermes or juno the right shoulder is sacred to jupiterweh note here spelled with one p in contradistinction to the general practice of the record the left buttock to venus the head should not be flayed but burnt simply and that in honour either of juno or minerva
the rite should not be employed on ordinary occasions but rarely and then for great purposes it should not be disclosed to any man
in the opinion of osv and lt these instructions partake of the character of black or at least grey magic the reader is requested to note that the temple had been formally closed before they were obtained
the following questions were then asked by osv and answered by lt
q what will be the result of yardley's mission
a successful on the whole but not entirely
q shall i know soon
a within 14 days say 10 or 11
hermes returns and kisses lt on lips navel and phallus
q will l get k's dances on
a yes
q big success
a yes
q how soon
a within three months
lt will be released within two months from everything he will get into a new stratum of karma he is going away eastwards in june he marries but returns to the great work in september – ps all quite wrong without a single exception
its conditions are quite altered lt having acquired a great fortune
osv goes away on a long journey to the east leaving lt in charge x this results in serious trouble with regards to krishnamurti
let osv not allow 493 to enter into scorpio
osv what is 493
lt connected with water and with cremers it is she that stirs up strife
osv what is 493
a it is connected with osv's dealings with cremers osv has told her too much
q what is 493
a a book of a mercurial nature stolen by cremers don't let that get into scorpio  energized enthusiasm which got into  the questioner in a fit of despair abandons the unequal contest
cremers will either write to lt or communicate indirectly with him ps all this is entirely wrong
hermes now gives a gold ring to lt for osv the bezel of this ring is a ruby with a white fleur-de-lys on each side of it the ring is gold
opposite the ruby are the initials str this ring is the crown of the phallus the yoni of thoth the collar of the ape of thoth
concerning the rites osv is always to be first to scry lt is to write down in the scrying lt is always to be the priest these rites are never to be done for more than six successive nightsnote evidently the rite of mercury is exceptional for it asks 8 nights wednesday to wednesday see above om and four is a better number the rites should never begin earlier than nine o'clock at night and should never last longer than three hours and a half
these are the colours of certain gods –
priapus – yellow and purple
iacchus – scarlet and green
venus– blue white and gold
minerva– white and silver with a little dark blue
pan– crimson
the floor should be white but on festivals and special occasions black and white or red and white squares
further instructions will be given from time to time
music may be employed in the rite but in a subordinate manner it should be soft and stringed
celebrants of the rite should not be bare-headed but should wear head-dresses of white or such other colour as may be indicated
after five weeks other directions will be given until then work as aforesaid
i now see the figure drawn hereunderweh note not available at this time it is familiar to osv as the sign of a certain grade and the name of it is str
hermes now touches lt's lips with his caduceus and gives this last message to osv beyond nothing is everything he then kisses lt and departs
the ninth working
monday jan 19 1914 ev
die sol 1145 pm–1230 am
a most admirable working the best we have done for juppiter during osv's invocation of amoun his vibration of the name divine was echoed in second by a voice audible to the ear now then fair omens dexter prosper ye the work during the quia patris fra lt at the altar of the east being genuflected beheld the colossal form of juppiter our father manubis plenis yea with gold were his hands full praise unto our father and our god! in the morning fra osv awoke early having as hath only occurred to him once before dreamed a story which he remembered he therefore spent the day from 8 am to 3 pm in writing down this story which he called 'the stratagem' may it bring fame and fortune
the esoteric record of the ninth working
die sol jan 19 1145
the rites of juppiter were duly performed on this and the next two days with regard to the ceremony of wednesday i have to add to the esoteric record that fra osv was at one time a consecrated prostitute in the temple of the sun at agrigentum this temple had a 'long square' 2 x 1 outer court in the upper square was a square temple – with facade and pillars osv whose name was at that time asteris or something similar used to sit on the steps and receive sacrifices i think the name was astarte but am afraid of having been rationalaseria is the exact name of the great mother goddess in tyre i did not know this i regard this as a story proof of the accuracy of the vision om
the great sacrifice of spring was to cut open a bull and lay a virgin in the hot carcass there to be violated by the high priest she was finally choked in the bull's blood in orgasmo within the temple was a circular domed shrine about 40 feet across the priestesses used to carry their offerings to the altar of incense in the east while the blood of the victims went to a big font in the west the door of the shrine was in the north in the south was a statue of a sun-god of a syrian type – rather more like bacchus than apollo in the centre was a light movable couch rather like one sees in pictures at naples it was used in the midnight ceremony to obtain oracles
the secret of the temple was the midnight sun globes of fire used to gather on the font and from the other altar and begin to revolve in the shrine
they would coalesce and then become one which stood single and unmoving all night only fading with dawn astarte surprised the secret and penetrated into the shrine at the midnight sacrifice and adoration of this globe she was slain instantly by the priests who passed their swords again and again through her body this death was extreme pleasure the body was thrown out upon the court at the foot of the temple steps and made tabu so that it might be 'devoured by the sun'
she had incurred this incarnation as the result of various misdemeanors in greece about an hundred years before her incarnations had always been at short intervals it appears that in the beginning most people cannot bear frequent incarnations and need long restorative periods of rest and peace but superior spirits take a great oath and get on faster they suffer more in proportion you can recognise them by sensitiveness which is sometimes in the painful or morbid degree this is the case when the great work has been forgotten for an incarnation or a part of it the idea is to impress the fact of the oath upon the sufferer
astarte in her grecian avatar had been a rather worldly priest her childhood was one of great misery she had been taken by pirates and ill-treated– she came from leghorn or its neighbourhood a ship-wreck left her on the coast of sicily people found her and finding her an excellent prostitute she was now 14 put her in a brothel she hated the life at a spring festival she was lucky enough to attract a young priest who took her put her through a year's purification and added her to the temple staff but she only saw a dull routine though applying herself to advancement in her profession by the skill of her embraces however by the age of 20 or there-abouts she 'got religion' and began to act con amore from this time she was rather the terror of the temple she used to do strange things excesses record-breaking acts and so on in fact she was a little mad had a touch of the sun as it were however she got the name of being inspired now and then and was used in some of the public ceremonies she made a young priest fall madly in love with her on one such occasion and they violated their vows by carnal copulation of an irreligious character in this way she made him tell her the secret of the temple she then killed him the same night so that he should never betray the fact that he had betrayed the mysteries
she was a slim lean nervous girl with a long face a roman nose rather full lips very strong from constant exercise a habit of wriggling as if consumed by an inward itch abundant and very wiry black hair which she sometimes dyed very strong and very sharp and white regular teeth deep violet eyes very wide apart and set obliquely like chinese eyes her cheek-bones were high and her expressions fierve her breasts were quite undeveloped and her body body like a man's or rather like a boy's her vulva was lean and muscular the nymphae hardly developed at all
astarte was her temple name her own was felicia her parents were peasants vine-dressers in winter woodcutters this description is most strangely like alostrael

die martiis 1130 pm – die mercurii 1215 am
the ceremony as usual fra osv saw juppiter in his form as ammon-ra plumed and phallic standing in the east during the verbal invocation of amoun this became much intensified during the versicle he lost all sense of the physical and was only recalled to it by its climax subsequently he heard and so did fra lt clear and distinct 'astral' bells
the eleventh working
wednesday jan 21 1914 ev
during the day the brethren were out of harmony but conquered the feeling of animosity by will a full banquet as ordained being consumed the brethren repaired to the temple fra osv opened the same at 11 pm die mercurii to the sight of osv during the versicle ammon-ra appeared in the east juppiter himself filling the temple this also appeared as a cone of white light whirling about the image of the all - one that is upon the altar of the elements after the versicle fra lt obtained a message in angelic to the effect that the gods wish to regain their dominion upon earth these initiated brethren being as fiery arrows shot by them in their war against the slave-gods a four-fold sacrifice was demanded and that a sacrifice of cruelty therefore did …/… and ultimately he-pe - pe-he the temple was closed 145 am die joviis fra lt still 155 lying entranced the god is now effective and with a single sacrifice on his night early to close before midnight will that equilibration of the 4 and the 7 be accomplished die joviis 2 am frater lt says 'tetelestai' nb this is the formula of 7=4 thus making 4 either way yet 7 in all and on this third night forming the sacred tau during this working fra lt again heard the astral bells
also concerning the sacrifices it was revealed in the night during the sleep of exhaustion to fra osv that the esence of the operation is the freeing of the elemental spirit of an animal soul this may be done by death or by complete exhaustion either through pleasure or through pain in this death-like trance the spirit becomes free to wander and is united to the invoked god in the case of death this is permanent and goes to increase the body of the god on the planet we should therefore when we can obtain a closed and inviolable precinct and slay therein victims daily in the meantime let one of the brethren at least be reduced always to exhaustion by wine and by the infliction of wounds and by the ceremony itself and if he utter oracles let them be not consciously given and if the true god be duly invoked they will be divine and this is the oracle which juppiter gave unto fra osv in the night or early morning of his day
during all this day fra lt is oveshadowed by juppiter the world about him appears a vision of the future his eyes are dilated he cannot read his manner is as one stupefied or entranced
the twelfth working
thursday jan 22 1914 ev
the banquet restored fra lt to a comparatively normal condition at 955 pm die joviis the temple was opened as usual the sacrifice was offered fra osv perinde ac cadaver and the temple closed at 11 pm fra osv was completely exhausted thus endeth the first series of the complete working of jupiter
friday am
there is certainly some result of these invocations for matters move strangely five people who arranged to come to see me in paris all failed and both business letters urgent and private letters remain unanswered i assume that this is the 'fallow' period which follows the sowing of the seed but hermes produced instantly a direct result i take it that juppiter being a slow and steady god moves not so easily but with far more power pm i mentioned this matter to fra lt as regards letters his experience is precisely similar to my own
the thirteenth working
monday january 26 1914 ev
on saturday the drought of result broke up suddenly both letters and visitors appeared all things that have occurred have been of the nature of juppiter but so far there has been no plentiful harvest naught as it were but green shoots peeping through the earth
the temple opened at about 1130 quia patris 1230 closing 2 am die martiis fra osv became inspired in a terpsichorean manner after the accendat and tu qui es much good force was obtained and two jataka stories during the day fra lt obtained a small juppiterian result fra osv kept an appointment which may conceivably lead to vast juppiterian results
the esoteric record of the thirteenth working
january 26 1914 began about 1130 ended about 1230
after the accendat osv did an inspired dance of the seductive-fugitive order after the haud secus the brethren revelled in the juppiterian atmosphere and then in talking about this osv remembered he had been a priestess in what he thought was greece of an orientalised type lt recognized this as crete osv agreed
lt saw a green figure constantly dancing around the altar
the ceremony was of initiation this dance was the temptation neophytes were accepted if laughingly indifferent or if on the other hand they refused to be played with and violated the woman no matter how she struggled half measures were punished by having their testicles removed by a special instrument on the principle of a candle-snuffer but with a regular cup instead of a guard after the operation the instrument was thrust upon the brazier and the man was thrust into the earthquake fissure where he perished miserably
when all the flesh was gone and the bones had dropped to the bottom the next initiation could take place
this temple had pillars a black floor shining like glass mirrors to render the chase difficult there were three priests the lion-mask the bull-mask and the eagle-mask
the initiate himself was the fourth kerub these mysteries are the same – or very nearly the same – as the samothracian mysteries
osv had 28 hand-maidens she was dressed in silver tissues representing the way in which the moon slips away from the sun and then falls back into his embraces that is the idea of the dance
osv's name was aia which is really gaia
twelve virgins were sacrificed annually one a month
released on menstruation because they became inpure and so could not live in the temple
this is the great idea of magicians in all time –
to obtain a messiah by some adaptation of the sexual process
in assyria they tried incest also in egypt the egyptians tried brothers and sisters the assyrians mothers and sons phoenicians tried fathers and daughters greeks and syrians mostly bestiality this idea came from india the jews sought to do this by invocation methods also by paedicatis feminarum the mohammedans tried homosexuality mediaeval philosophers tried to produce homunculi by making chemical experiments with semen
but the root idea is that any form of procreation other than the normal is likely to produce results of a magical character
either the father of the child should be a symbol of the sun or the mother a symbol of the moon
spring ceremonies in crete
there was a labyinth there they had the worship of apis from egypt see frazer and others on bull-worship shiva etc
there was a sacred bull in this labryinth quite white at the spring festival they sacrificed twelve virgins to him
et crudelis amor tauri et supposita furto
pasiphae ————— aeneid vi
they wanted to get a minotaur an incarnation of the sun a messiah they said they had one but they hadn't
lt was named mardocles fair very handsome squarish golden beard a very noble edition of rudolph cyriax hair curled in assyrian manner wore chiton
osv killed him by dancing badly
lt being initiated osv and hand-maidens came out and danced osv fell in love and spoiled her dancing
lt knew what to do and couldn't remain indifferent but couldn't be brutal and so at the last moment lt spared osv and was thrust out of the temple but neither killed nor castrated she was also expelled
lt and osv went penniless and sad into a town
osv did up lt's sandals which had come undone
lt despised osv for ruining his career he had been a merchant a very wealthy corn-merchant with a very rich father and he had given up everything for initiation lt was a special favourite of the high priest the high priest being a friend of his father
lt was about 24 or 25 but much older than his years
lt hated osv but was too chivalrous to leave her
lt only cared for osv while she danced he felt he had ruined osv's career as well as his own
we sat down two doors away from the cobbler's on a stone
osv did up lt's sandal strap the cobbler offered to do it free lt was so handsome we were asked to the evening meal
the cobbler had an ugly scolding wife looking like billiken or the duchess in alice
a tiny little back room with children including a boy of twelve or so
the cobbler wanted us to go on the staff this was perhaps in ephesus a sea-side place anyhow
his proposal was the only hope to avoid being sold for slaves by the magistrates
but we were too proud and said we would be sold for slaves and we were
a man with a country house and a beautiful wife bought us
his name like demetrius more like demephorius demephorus
we were employed about the house
it was part of the ordinary duty of a servant to amuse the family by various copulations only beautiful slaves were chosen for this purpose
osv died of pneumonia some few months after
mistress a really classic type syro-phoenician beauty grecian nose coal-black curls beautiful anklets bracelets etc swathed in purple nearly always thin mouth smile like gioconda but with corners turned down the man was a fool easy going rather like bourcier
all this was long before the trojan war
very civilized before the greek civilization we know of or perhaps more assyrian or phoenician
asia-minor the scene of this
they used oared galleys
i shall never forget the look you gave me in the slave market osv
i am always unlucky for you you know you always have to sacrifice everything for my love you don't want to in the least that is because we both have hold of the wrong end of the stick if only i could leave you and you could love me it would be lucky but that has apparently never happened mutual indifference and mutual passion and so on
we played instruments in corinth as girls
 had white skin lt chryssipe had yellow hair osv
we made popular lesbian songs all day —
we went on for years and years and years we were sixty and terribly famous … like zena and phyllis dare this devotion of ours became proverbial in corinth we had to keep it up exactly like a vicar and his wife in public
after forty-three and a half years it got awful then we retired to our country estates but we had the habit over there we turned into old maids we had really loved with the most intense and true passion for a year or so and then kept it up for profit
but we were not cynical about it we really fancied ourselves as the ideal lovers of corinth
incarnation about wolves forgotten diana of ephesus we went on a mission a business mission of a temple nature not lt thank god there were wolves a plague of them
the fourteenth working
the temple was opened on the stroke of midnight and closed at 17 am dei mercuri fra osv being completely exhausted the jovian pheonomena continue with steadiness but not with such force as to enable to say that the success of the operation is assured during the afternoon we went to the house of a lay sisterjane cheron and invoked the lord juppiter by incense of his sacred herbopium this rested us mentally and physically but caused some illness of a slight and temporary order
the fifteenth working
the temple opened at 1115 pm and closed at 1210 but the versicle was prolonged and very quiet probably owing to the experience of the afternoon hence the force was coherent crescent in a flat curve but very strong in its culmination the atmosphere of the temple is now extremely good not only in the ceremonies when it is mellow rich velvety luminous purple gold green are the chief colours strong without violence calm opulent etc etc but throughout the day we are excluding loose women and the like
the principal physical things are a green chameleon — like dancer named ahanael 762 and the usual elementals darting about ahannael is under bethor
the sixteenth working
the temple opened at about 1020 after the haud secus again of the soft steady watery tupe the god demanded blood osv cut a four-square on lt's breast and offered thereof lt then did a wonderful dance osv in shivasana osv became inspired the planetary spirits by the way are now plain to see next week the god demands that the image shall be placed in a vesica and a sparrow or if not a pigeon shall be slain therein before the accendat with these words nunc flavi jovi spumantem sanguine saevo passerem… or such other words as may be suggested by the art-batchelor w d who has been sent by juppiter from london on this account the blood only of a sparrow is to remain in the vesica and to be connected after the versicle with the magi by the sigil 4 on lt's heart right breast left breast and navel on the four nights the body is to be burnt for the last 4 nights both flesh and blood are to be sacrificed the temple closed at midnight to thursday midnight no other blood is to be taken but the banquets not drink save only pure water
it is to be noted that since the beginning of this operation the bank rate has fallen to 3 per cent and consols improved from 71 1/2 to 76 1/4 a gain to osv of over pounds 1400
on saturday osv received a letter which should bring pounds 500 within the next two months
i should mention that the possession of osv on thursday night was the most complete and material possession and has occurred to him most rarely
the directions were obtained with difficulty and his whole consciousness was wrapped up in the god the only expression being these words
sanguis et semen
the seventeenth working
the temple was opened about 1030 and closed at 1250 am 3214 ev
osv dedicated the bird to juppiter and set it free during the versicle osv lost consciousness after the quia patris lt the 4 cut on his right breast was to have acted as virgo a marvellous matter folled but no further rite was accomplished at 1 am fra lt was still too exhausted to speak osv doubts if he did well to avoid the apparent and obvious meaning of the instruction vouchsafed last thursday night this should be decided by the events of tuesday – thursday if unsatisfactory the birds let loose 2 on tuesday on wednesday should all 4 be slain on the last night of this series
the eighteenth working
the banquet of juppiter began at lunch then we bade bro sir b c hammondbenjamin charles hammond the good knight god - speed at the conclusion of the banquet the spirit of mars waxed strong and osv tare lt with bitter words to which fra lt like a good brother as he is replied with modesty humility courtesy forbearance and brotherly love the averse mercury also seized upon fra osv during the writing of this last sentence! however the bretheren embraced in the name of juppiter and opened the temple at 1030 a lengthy ceremony followed the usual rite being followed by … vatem … virgo … orally the image of the most high was thus richly adorned with due ornament the temple closed at 15 am dei mercurii the forces being completely absorbed
the nineteenth working
fra osv during the day had a feverish attack of something resembling influenza but receiving the remedy of juppiter from the hands of the lay-sister cheron was miraculously made whole though the aftermath still slightly inconveniences him he having taken the remedy in excess
the temple opened at 1128 closed at 1250 am dei jovis the ceremony being most magnificent query this represents the west wind as last night the east and the firstnight of this series the north during the versicle osv saw the sarcophagus of ankh-f-n-khonsu a misty dawn of gold at the east of the altar erect the ceremony raised fra osv from discomfort sleepiness and fever to the top of his form lt gets a white elephant with the word lex labor est + the phallus in its sense of the completed work also baphomet spelt beth-pe-mem taw 1082 weh note as two words to use mem-final note 1081 = tiphareth add 1 for the therein no! om the atmosphere is marvellous calm and sweet soft a the kisses of zephyros - a perfect peace and joy
during the day by the way fra osv got the idea that fra lt would make a perfect low comedian and thus gain much gold
the twentieth working
the temple opened at 100 closed at 11 pm dei jovis
on friday fra osv got a letter making a most valuable introduction also full confirmation of the other matter praise him!
fra osv's malady now reasserted itself however with great force he has much fever and bronchitis and is obliged to take to his bed to-day of the moon he is still very ill but yet determined to continue the operation as well as he may though with mained rites

the twenty-first working
the temple was opened mentally by osv at about 910 and closed at 923 in spite of all the handicap the ceremony went exceedingly well an excellent atmosphere was obtained and osv's temperature went down 4 degrees c!!!!
the twenty-second working
fra osv is now recovered and is ungrateful enough to the doctor – an excellent and clever practitioner to yet greater thanks to juppiter his temperature went down 3 c during the actual ceremony which opened at 930 and closed at 1015
this was in some respects the best we have yet done fra lt got juppiter in his pregnant phrase and went on with the mechanism of the accendat and the preparations for the performance of the versicle before osv had finished his hexagram ritual done after the verbal invocation of amoun but the haud secus itself was brilliant and inspired and the result overwhelming – a glow of stupendous success
the twenty-third working
fra osv worked very hard from 630 am after a bad night yet was well and strong in the ceremony which went magnificently at the quia patris he saw his shadow plainly on the dim reddish wall in the east although at the west there was but another such wall and the firelight in the north was without effective radiance the ceremony was more brilliant and ecstatic even than last night fra lt is even more completely exhausted than before
318 am message for ag aimee gouraud… without pity act guests dally on the couches of mother of pearl in the garden go to the holy house of hathor and offer the five jewels of the cow on her altar then go under the night-stars in the desert and invoke nuit result establishment of nuit cult a previous divination had given two days before is not the nile a beautiful water the question being should i go to tunis for ag tunis being nearer the pillars of hercules and the ocean of the west the juppiteran events of a minor character are now so frequent that they are too many to record without tedium contrary events to not occur at all
the twenty-fourth working
fra osv had a sleepless night and had to work all day yet opening the temple at 615 and closing it at 7 this great operation was brought to a successful end
the ceremony was calm and deep the very aroma of earth in spring after the work fra lt performed divination by thelema and obtained this versicle
i am thou and the pillar is established in the void
during the haud secus fra lt was taken by juppiter to be his cup-bearer fra osv beheld the violet formless and of dhanic intensity
ps result fra osv obtained the gifts of juppiter as he asked and was further made like juppiter in his aspect as amoun during the whole summer he had but to ask to obtain
fra lt on the contrary became juppiter the bestower and many folk became his guests

liberdcccclxii=`here beginneth the book of
the meditations on the
twelvefold adora-
tion and the
unity of
god
☾
the chapter known as
the perception of god
that is revealed unto man for a snare
i adore thee by the twelvefold snare and by the unity thereof
in the beginning there was naught and naught spake unto naught saying let us beget on the nakedness of our nothingness the limitless eternal identical and united and without will intention thought word desire or deed it was so
then in the depths of nothingness hovered the limitless as a raven in the night seeing naught hearing naught and understanding naught neither was it seen nor heard nor understood for as yet countenance beheld not countenance
and as the limitless stretched forth its wings an unextended unextendable light became colourless formless conditionless effluent naked and essential as a crystalline dew of creative effulgence and fluttering as a dove betwixt day and night it vibrated forth a lustral crown of glory
and out of the blinding whiteness of the crown grew an eye like unto an egg of an humming-bird cherished on a platter of burnished silver
thus i beheld theeo my god the lid of whose eye is as the night of chaos and the pupil thereof as the marshalled order of the spheres
for i am but as a blind man who wandering through the noontide perceiveth not the loveliness of day and even as he whose eyes are unenlightened beholdeth not the greatness of this world in the depths of a starless night so am i who am not able to search the unfathomable depths of thy wisdom
for what am i that i durst look upon thy countenance purblind one of small understanding that i am blindly groping through the night of mine ignorance like unto a little maggot hid in the dark depths of a corrupted corpse
thereforeo my god fashion me into a five-pointed star of ruby burning beneath the foundations of thy unity that i may mount the pillar of thy glory and be lost in adoration of the triple unity of thy godhead i beseech theeo thou who art to me as the finger of light thrust through the black clouds of chaos i beseech theeo my god hearken thou unto my cry
theno my god am i not risen as the sun that eateth up ocean as a golden lion that feedeth on a blue-grey wolf so shall i become one with thy beauty worn upon thy breast as the centre of a sixfold star of ruby and of sapphire
yeao god gird thou me upon thy thigh as a warrior girdeth his sword smite my acuteness into the earth and as a sower casteth his seed into the furrows of the plough do thou beget upon me these adorations of thy unityo my conqueror
and thou shalt carry me upon thine hipo thou flashing god as a black mother of the south country carrieth her babe whence i shall reach my lips to thy pap and sucking out thy stars shed them in these adorations upon the earth
moreovero god my god thou who hast cloven me with thine amethystine phallus with thy phallus adamantine with thy phallus of gold and ivory thus am i cleft in twain as two halves of a child that is split asunder by the sword of the eunuchs and mine adorations are divided and one contendeth against his brother unite thou me even as a split tree that closeth itself again upon the axe that my song of praise unto thee may be one song
for i am thy chosen virgino my god exalt thou me unto the throne of the mother unto the garden of supernal dew unto the unutterable sea
amen and amen of amen and amen of amen of amen and amen of amen of amen of amen
♈
the chapter known as
the twelvefold affirmation of god and the unity thereof

♊
o thou throbbing music of life and death thou rhythmic harmony of the world yea as i listen to the echo of thy voice my rapture is but as the whisper of the wings of a butterfly
♋
o thou burning tempest of blinding sand thou whirlwind from the depths of darkness yea as i struggle through thee through thee my strength is but as a dove's down floating forth on the purple nipples of the storm
♌
o thou crowned giant among great giants thou crimson-sworded soldier of war yea as i battle with thee thou masterest me as a lion that slayeth a babe that is cradled in lilies
♍
o thou shadowy vista of darkness thou cryptic book of the fir-clad hills yea as i search the key of thy house i find my hope but as a rushlight sheltered in the hands of a little child
♎
o thou great labour of the firmament thou tempest tossed roaring of the aires yea as i sink in the depths of thine affliction mine anguish is but as the smile on the lips of a sleeping babe
♏
o thou depths of the inconceivable thou cryptic unutterable god yea as i attempt to understand thee my wisdom is but as an abacus in the lap of an aged man
♐
o thou transfigured dream of blinding light thou beatitude of wonderment yea as i behold thee mine understanding is but as the glimpse of a rainbow through a storm of blinding snow
♑
o thou steel-girdered mountain of mountains thou crested summit of majesty yea as i climb thy grandeur i find i have but surmounted one mote of dust floating in a beam of thy glory
♒
o thou empress of light and of darkness thou pourer-forth of the stars of night yea as i gaze upon thy countenance mine eyes are as the eyes of a blind man smitten by a torch of burning fire
♓
o thou crimson gladness of the midnight thou flamingo north of brooding light yea as i rise up before thee my joy is but as a raindrop smitten through by an arrow of the western sun
☉
o thou golden crown of the universe thou diadem of dazzling brightness yea as i burn up before thee my light is but as a falling star seen between the purple fingers of the night

o my god thou mighty one thou creator of all things i renounce unto thee the moonlit peaks of the mountains and the arrow-shapen kiss of the firs and all the travail of the winds so that i may be lost on the summit of thy glory and be consumed in the unutterable joy of thine everlasting rapture
♑
o my god thou mighty one thou creator of all things i renounce unto thee the goatish ache of the years and the cryptic books and all the majesty of their enshrouded words so that i may be entangled in thy wordless wisdom and be consumed in the unutterable joy of thine everlasting rapture
♒
o my god thou mighty one thou creator of all things i renounce unto thee the wine-cups of merriment and the eyes of the wanton bearers and all the lure of their soft limbs so that i may be made drunk on the vine of thy splendour and be consumed in the unutterable joy of thine everlasting rapture
♓
o my god thou mighty one thou creator of all things i renounce unto thee the hissing of mad waters and the trumpeting of the thunder and all thy tongues of dancing flame so that i may be swept up in the breath of thy nostrils and be consumed in the unutterable joy of thine everlasting rapture
♈
o my god thou mighty one thou creator of all things i renounce unto thee the crimson lust of the chase and the blast of the brazen war-horns and all the gleaming of the spears so that like an hart i may be brought to bay in thine arms and be consumed in the unutterable joy of thine everlasting rapture
☉
o my god thou mighty one thou creator of all things i renounce unto thee all that self which is myself that black sun which shineth in self's day whose glory blindeth thy glory so that i may become as a rushlight in thine abode and be consumed in the unutterable joy of thine everlasting rapture

the chapter known as
the unconsciousness of god
that is hidden from man for a sign
i adore thee by the twelvefold sign and by the unity thereof
the light of my life is as the light of two moons one rising and the other setting one increasing and the other waning the one growing fat as the other groweth lean like a paunchy thief sucking dry a skin of amber wine yet though the light of the first devoureth the light of the second nevertheless the light of the second disgorgeth the light of the first so that there is neither the desire of light nor the need of light— all being as a woven twilight of day and night a madness of mingling moons yet i behold
now mine eyes are seven and are as stars about a star and the lids of mine eyes are fourteen two to each eye also have i seven arms to do the bidding of the seven eyes and each arm hath an hand of three fingers so that i may rule the great ocean and burn it up with the spirit of flame and that i may drown the fire in the abode of the waters thus i am rendered naked for neither flame nor water can clothe me therefore am i as a breath of wind blown over an earth of adamant that knoweth neither sorrow nor rejoicing then do i abide as a river of light between the night of chaos and the day of creation
two are the moons of my madness like the horns on the head of a goat and between them burneth a pyramid of flame which consumeth neither but blindeth both so that the one beholdeth not the other notwithstanding when the one is lost in the water and the other is burnt up in the flame they become united in the form of a woman fashioned of earth and of air who without husband is yet mother of many sons
now the sons are in truth but one son and the one son but a daughter draped and never naked for her mother is naked therefore is she robed and she is called the light of my love for she is concealed and cannot be seen as the sun burneth over her and drowneth her in fire whilst below her surgeth the sea whose waves are as flames of water when thou hast licked up the ocean thou shalt not see her because of the fire and when thou hast swallowed the sun surely shall the waters be driven from thee so that though the fire be thine the water hath slipped thee as a dog its leash yet the path is straight
along it shalt thou journey and then shalt thou learn that the fear of death is the blood of the world so the woman dressed herself in the shrouds of the dead and decked herself with the bones of the fallen and all feared her therefore they lived but she feared life therefore she wove a dew-moon in her tangled hair as a sign of the fickleness of death and wept tears of bitter sorrow that she should live in the blossom of her youth and her tears crept like scorpions down her cheeks and sped away in the darkness like serpents and for each serpent came there an eagle which did carry it away
why weep said the balance swinging to the left why laugh said the balance swinging to the right why not remain still answered the hand that held the balance and the balance replied because on my right laughs death and on my left weeps a virgin
then the voice of the hand said to the girl why weep and the maid answered because death maketh jest of my life then the hand stayed the balance and at once the girl saw that she was death and that death that had sat opposite her was in truth a motherless babe so she took the child she had conceived in the arms of fear and went her way laughing
and the infant grew strong yet its strength was in its weakness and though to look at it from before was to look upon a man-child from behind it was a little girl with golden hair now when the child wished to tempt a maid he faced and approached her and when the child wished to tempt a man she turned her back on him and fled
but one day the child met at the self-same hour love and the man seeing a woman approached her eagerly and the woman seeing a man fled so that he might capture her thus it came about that the child met the child and wondered not knowing that the child had lost the child so it was that they walked side by side
then that part of the child that was man loved and lusted for that part of the child that was woman and each knew not that each was the other and felt that they were two and yet one nevertheless one and yet two and when one said who art thou the other answered at the self-same moment who am i
soon becoming perplexed if i were thou or if thou were i it came about that the i mingled with the thou and the thou with the i so that six added to ten became sixteen which is felicity for it is the interplay of the elements four are the elements that make man and four are the elements that make woman thus was the child reborn
but though the man ruleth the woman and the woman ruleth the man the child ruleth both its mother and father and being five is emperor over the kingdom of their hearts to its father it giveth four and to its mother it giveth four yet it remaineth five for it hath of its father an half and of its mother an half but in itself it is equal to both its father and its mother for it is father of fathers and mother of mothers
therefore is it one whole and not two halves and being one is thirteen which is called nothing when it is all-things amen without lie and amen of amen and amen of amen of amen`
liberlxi=`in the name of the initiator amen
in the beginning was initiation the flesh profiteth nothing the mind profiteth nothing that which is unknown to you and above these while firmly based upon their equilibrium giveth life
in all systems of religion is to be found a system of initiation which may be defined as the process by which a man comes to learn that unknown crown
though none can communicate either the knowledge or the power to achieve this which we may call the great work it is yet possible for initiates to guide others
every man must overcome his own obstacles expose his own illusions yet others may assist him to do both and they may enable him altogether to avoid many of the false paths leading no whither which tempt the weary feet of the uninitiated pilgrim they can further insure that he is duly tried and tested for there are many who think themselves to be masters who have not even begun to tread the way of service that leads thereto
now the great work is one and the initiation is one and the reward is one however diverse are the symbols wherein the unutterable is clothed
hear then the history of the system which this lection gives you the opportunity of investigating
listen we pray you with attention for once only does the great order knock at any one door
whosoever knows any member of that order as such can never know another until he too has attained to mastery
here therefore we pause that you may thoroughly search yourself and consider if you are yet fitted to take an irrevocable step
for the reading of that which follows is recorded
some years ago a number of cipher mss were discovered and deciphered by certain students they attracted much attention as they purported to derive from the rosicrucians you will readily understand that the genuineness of the claim matters no whit such literature being judged by itself not by its reputed sources
among the mss was one which gave the address of a certain person in germany who is known to us as sda those who discovered the ciphers wrote to sda and in accordance with the instructions received an order was founded which worked in a semi-secret manner
after some time sda died further requests for help were met with a prompt refusal from the colleagues of sda it was written by one of them that sdahow much more then one of themselves and that one most highly reveredthey were to be admitted to the eternal and invisible order that hath no name among men
they therefore who had with smiling faces abandoned their homes their possessions their wives their children in order to perform the great work could with steady calm and firm correctness abandon the great work itself for this is the last and greatest projection of the alchemist
also one vvvvv arose an exalted adept of the rank of master of the temple or this much he disclosed to the exempt adepts and his utterance is enshrined in the sacred writings
30 such are liber legis liber cordis cincti serpente liber liberi vel lapidis lazuli and such others whose existence may one day be divulged unto you beware lest you interpret them either in the light or in the darkness for only in lvx may they be understood
also he conferred upon dds om and another the authority of the triad who in turn have delegated it unto others and they yet again so that the body of initiates may be perfect even from the crown unto the kingdom and beyond
32 for perfection abideth not in the pinnacles or in the foundations but in the ordered harmony of one with all `
