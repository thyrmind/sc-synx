joy let us follow on the wings of the gale even unto the holy house of hathor let us offer the five jewels of the cow upon her altar again the inhuman voice i rear my titan bulk into the teeth of the gale and i smite and prevail and swing me out over the sea there is a strange pale god a god of pain and deadly wickedness my own soul bites into itself like a scorpion ringed with fire that pallid

the still waters of my soul so that my mind and my body were healed of their disease selfknowledge yea an angel troubled the waters this was the cry of him iiiooshbthioiiiiamamthibiii nor did i sing this for a thousand times a night for a thousand nights before thou camest o my flaming god and pierced me with thy spear thy scarlet robe unfolded the whole heavens so that the gods said all is burning it is the end also thou didst set thy lips to the wound and suck out a million eggs and thy mother sat upon them and lo stars and stars and ultimate things whereof stars are the atoms then i perceived thee o my god sitting like a white cat upon the trelliswork of the arbour and the hum of the spinning worlds was but thy pleasure o white cat the sparks fly from thy fur thou dost crackle with splitting the worlds i have seen more of thee in the white cat than i saw in the vision of æons in the boat of ra did i travel but i never found upon the visible universe any being like unto thee thou wast like a winged white horse and i raced thee through eternity against the lord of the gods so still we race thou wast like a flake of snow falling in the pineclad woods in a moment thou wast lost in a wilderness of the like and the unlike but i beheld the beautiful god at the back of the blizzard and thou wast he also i read in a great book on ancient skin was written in letters of gold verbum fit verbum also vitriol and the hierophants name vvvvv all this wheeled in fire in starfire rare and far and utterly lonely even as thou and i o desolate soul my god yea and the writing it is well this is the voice which shook the earth eight times he cried aloud and by eight and by eight shall i count thy favours oh thou elevenfold god yea and by many more by the ten in the twentytwo directions even as the perpendicular of the pyramid so shall thy favours be if i number them they are one excellent is thy love oh lord thou art revealed by the darkness and he who gropeth in the horror of the groves shall haply catch thee even as a snake that seizeth on a little singingbird i have caught thee o my soft thrush i am like a hawk of motherofemerald i catch thee by instinct though my eyes fail from thy glory yet they are but foolish folk yonder i see them on the yellow sand all clad in tyrian purple they draw their shining god unto the land in nets they build a fire to the lord of fire and cry unhallowed words even the dreadful curse amri maratza maratza atman deona lastadza maratza maritza marán then do they cook the shining god and gulp him whole these are evil folk o beautiful boy let us pass on to the otherworld let us make ourselves into a pleasant bait into a seductive shape i will be like a splendid naked woman with ivory breasts and golden nipples my whole body shall be like the milk of the stars i will be lustrous and greek a courtesan of delos of the unstable isle thou shalt be like a little red worm on a hook but thou and i will catch our fish alike then wilt thou be a shining fish with golden back and silver belly i will be like a violent beautiful man stronger than two score bulls a man of the west bearing a great sack of precious jewels upon a staff that is greater than the axis of the all and the fish shall be sacrificed to thee and the strong man crucified for me and thou and i will kiss and atone for the wrong of the beginning yea for the wrong of the beginning o my beautiful god i swim in thy heart like a trout in the mountain torrent i leap from pool to pool in my joy i am goodly with brown and gold and silver why i am lovelier than the russet autumn woods at the first snowfall and the crystal cave of my thought is lovelier than i only one fishhook can draw me out it is a woman kneeling by the bank of the stream it is she that pours the bright dew over herself and into the sand so that the river gushes forth there is a bird on yonder myrtle only the song of that bird can draw me out of the pool of thy heart o my god who is this neapolitan boy that laughs in his happiness his lover is the mighty crater of the mountain of fire i saw his charred limbs borne down the slopes in a stealthy tongue of liquid stone and oh the chirp of the cicada i remember the days when i was cacique in mexico o my god wast thou then as now my beautiful lover was my boyhood then as now thy toy thy joy verily i remember those iron days i remember how we drenched the bitter lakes with our torrent of gold how we sank the treasurable image in the crater of citlaltepetl how the good flame lifted us even unto the lowlands setting us down in the impenetrable forest yea thou wast a strange scarlet bird with a bill of gold i was thy mate in the forests of the lowland and ever we heard from afar the shrill chant of mutilated priests and the insane clamour of the sacrifice of maidens there was a weird winged god that told us of his wisdom we attained to be starry grains of gold dust in the sands of a slow river yea and that river was the river of space and time also we parted thence ever to the smaller ever to the greater until now o sweet god we are ourselves the same o god of mine thou art like a little white goat with lightning in his horns i love thee i love thee every breath every word every thought every deed is an act of love with thee the beat of my heart is the pendulum of love the songs of me are the soft sighs the thoughts of me are very rapture and my deeds are the myriads of thy children the stars and the atoms let there be nothing let all things drop into this ocean of love be this devotion a potent spell to exorcise the demons of the five ah god all is gone thou dost consummate thy rapture falútli falútli there is a solemnity of the silence there is no more voice at all so shall it be unto the end we who were dust shall never fall away into the dust so shall it be then o my god the breath of the garden of spices all these have a savour averse the cone is cut with an infinite ray the curve of hyperbolic life springs into being farther and farther we float yet we are still it is the chain of systems that is falling away from us first falls the silly world the world of the old grey land falls it unthinkably far with its sorrowful bearded face presiding over it it fades to silence and woe we to silence and bliss and the face is the laughing face of eros smiling we greet him with the secret signs he leads us into the inverted palace there is the heart of blood a pyramid reaching its apex down beyond the wrong of the beginning bury me unto thy glory o beloved o princely lover of this harlot maiden within the secretest chamber of the palace it is done quickly yea the seal is set upon the vault there is one that shall avail to open it nor by memory nor by imagination nor by prayer nor by fasting nor by scourging nor by drugs nor by ritual nor by meditation only by passive love shall he avail he shall await the sword of the beloved and bare his throat for the stroke then shall his blood leap out and write me runes in the sky yea write me runes in the sky vi thou wast a priestess o my god among the druids and we knew the powers of the oak we made us a temple of stones in the shape of the universe even as thou didst wear openly and i concealed there we performed many wonderful things by midnight by the waning moon did we work over the plain came the atrocious cry of wolves we answered we hunted with the pack we came even unto the new chapel and thou didst bear away the holy graal beneath thy druid vestments secretly and by stealth did we drink of the informing sacrament then a terrible disease seized upon the folk of the grey land and we rejoiced o my god disguise thy glory come as a thief and let us steal away the sacraments in our groves in our cloistral cells in our honeycomb of happiness let us drink let us drink it is the wine that tinges everything with the true tincture of infallible gold there are deep secrets in these songs it is not enough to hear the bird to enjoy song he must be the bird i am the bird and thou art my song o my glorious galloping god thou reinest in the stars thou drivest the constellations seven abreast through the circus of nothingness thou gladiator god i play upon mine harp thou fightest the beasts and the flames thou takest thy joy in the music and i in the fighting thou and i are beloved of the emperor see he has summoned us to the imperial dais the night falls it is a great orgy of worship and bliss the night falls like a spangled cloak from the shoulders of a prince upon a slave he rises a free man cast thou o prophet the cloak upon these slaves a great night and scarce fires therein but freedom for the slave that its glory shall encompass so also i went down into the great sad city there dead messalina bartered her crown for poison from the dead locusta there stood caligula and smote the seas of forgetfulness who wast thou o cæsar that thou knewest god in an horse for lo we beheld the white horse of the saxon engraven upon the earth and we beheld the horses of the sea that flame about the old grey land and the foam from their nostrils enlightens us ah but i love thee god thou art like a moon upon the iceworld thou art like the dawn of the utmost snows upon the burntup flats of the tigers land by silence and by speech do i worship thee but all is in vain only thy silence and thy speech that worship me avail wail o ye folk of the grey land for we have drunk your wine and left ye but the bitter dregs yet from these we will distil ye a liquor beyond the nectar of the gods there is value in our tincture for a world of spice and gold for our red powder of projection is beyond all possibilities there are few men there are enough we shall be full of cupbearers and the wine is not stinted o dear my god what a feast thou hast provided behold the lights and the flowers and the maidens taste of the wines and the cates and the splendid meats breathe in the perfumes and the clouds of little gods like woodnymphs that inhabit the nostrils feel with your whole body the glorious smoothness of the marble coolth and the generous warmth of the sun and the slaves let the invisible inform all the devouring light of its disruptive vigour yea all the world is split apart as an old grey tree by the lightning come o ye gods and let us feast thou o my darling o my ceaseless sparrowgod my delight my desire my deceiver come thou and chirp at my right hand this was the tale of the memory of al ain the priest yea of al ain the priest vii by the burning of the incense was the

instrument tuned to thy rapture yet art thou ever apart even as i i remember a certain holy day in the dusk of the year in the dusk of the equinox of osiris when first i beheld thee visibly when first the dreadful issue was fought out when the ibisheaded one charmed away the strife i remember thy first kiss even as a maiden should nor in the dark byways was there another thy kisses abide there is none other beside thee in the whole universe of love my god i love thee o thou goat with gilded horns thou beautiful bull of apis thou beautiful serpent of apep thou beautiful child of the pregnant goddess thou hast stirred in thy sleep o ancient sorrow of years thou hast raised thine head to strike and all is dissolved into the abyss of glory an end to the letters of the words an end to the

called night and hades and the day of wrath but i am his captain and i bear his cup fear me not with my spearmen they shall slay the demons with their petty prongs ye shall be free ah slaves ye will not ye know not how to will yet the music of my spears shall be a song of freedom a great bird shall sweep from the abyss of joy and bear ye away to be my cupbearers come o my god in one last rapture let us attain to the union with the many in the silence of things in the night of forces beyond the accursèd domain of the three let us enjoy our love my darling my darling away away beyond the assembly and the law and the enlightenment unto an anarchy of solitude and darkness for even thus must we veil the brilliance of our self my darling my darling o my god but the love in me bursts over the bonds of space and time my love is spilt among them that love not love my wine is poured out for them that never tasted wine the fumes thereof shall intoxicate them and the vigour of my love shall breed mighty children from their maidens yea without draught without embrace and the voice answered yea these things shall be then i sought a word for myself nay for myself and the word came o thou it

of pearl we will sail down the river of amrit even to the yew groves of yama where we may rejoice exceedingly the joy of men shall be our silver gleam their woe our blue gleam all in the mother of pearl the scribe was wroth thereat he spake o adonai and my master i have borne the inkhorn and the pen without pay in order that i might search this river of amrit and sail thereon as one of ye this i demand for my fee that i partake of the echo of your kisses and immediately it was granted unto him nay but not therewith was he content by an infinite abasement unto shame did he strive then a

was a maiden that strayed among the corn and sighed then grew a new birth a narcissus and therein she forgot her sighing and her loneliness even instantly rode hades heavily upon her and ravished her

vintage let us eat of her grapes and be drunken thereon and v v v v v answered and said o my lord my dove my excellent one how shall this word seem unto the children of men and he answered him not as

have i not the key thereof i am clothed with the body of flesh i am one with the eternal and omnipotent god then said adonai thou hast the head of the hawk and thy phallus is the phallus of asar thou knowest the white and thou knowest the black and thou knowest that these are one but why seekest thou the knowledge of their equivalence and he said that my work may be right and adonai said the

the deadly embrace of the snake and of the goat i paid the infernal homage to the shame of khem therein was this virtue that the one became the all moreover i beheld a vision of a river there was a little boat thereon and in it under purple sails was a golden woman an image of asi wrought in finest gold also the river was of blood and the boat of shining steel then i loved her and loosing my girdle cast myself into the stream i gathered myself into the little boat and for many days and nights did i love her burning beautiful incense before her yea i gave her of the flower of my youth but she stirred not only by my kisses i defiled her so that she turned to blackness before me yet i worshipped her and gave her of the flower of my youth also it came to pass that thereby she sickened and corrupted before me almost i cast myself into the stream then at the end appointed her body was whiter than the milk of the stars and her lips red and warm as the sunset and her life of a white heat like the heat of the midmost sun then rose she up from the abyss of ages of sleep and her body embraced me altogether i melted into her beauty and was glad the river also became the river of amrit and the little boat was the chariot of the flesh and the sails thereof the blood of the heart that beareth me that beareth me o serpent woman of the stars i even i have fashioned thee from a pale image of fine gold also the holy one came upon me and i beheld a white swan floating in the blue between its wings i sate and the æons fled away then the swan flew and dived and soared yet no whither we went a little crazy boy that rode with me spake unto the swan and said who art thou that dost float and fly and dive and soar in the inane behold these many æons have passed whence camest thou whither wilt thou go and laughing i chid him saying no whence no whither the swan being silent he answered then if with no goal why this eternal journey and i laid my head against the head of the swan and laughed saying is there not joy ineffable in this aimless winging is there not weariness and impatience for who would attain to some goal and the swan was ever silent ah but we floated in the infinite abyss joy joy white swan bear thou ever me up between thy wings o silence o rapture o end of things visible and invisible this is all mine who am not radiant god let me fashion an image of gems and gold for thee that the people may cast it down and trample it to dust that thy glory may be seen of them nor shall it be spoken in the markets that i am come who should come but thy coming shall be the one word thou shalt manifest thyself in the unmanifest in the secret places men shall meet with thee and thou shalt overcome them i saw a pale sad boy that lay upon the marble in the sunlight and wept by his side was the forgotten lute ah but he wept then came an eagle from the abyss of glory and overshadowed him so black was the shadow that he was no more visible but i heard the lute lively discoursing through the blue still air ah messenger of the beloved one let thy shadow be over me thy name is death it may be or shame or love so thou bringest me tidings of the beloved one i shall not ask thy name where is now the master cry the little crazy boys he is dead he is shamed he is wedded and their mockery shall ring round the world but the master shall have had his reward the laughter of the mockers shall be a ripple in the hair of the beloved one behold the abyss of the great deep therein is a mighty dolphin lashing his sides with the force of the waves there is also an harper of gold playing infinite tunes then the dolphin delighted therein and put off his body and became a bird the harper also laid aside his harp and played infinite tunes upon the pan pipe then the bird desired exceedingly this bliss and laying down its wings became a faun of the forest the harper also laid down his pan pipe and with the human voice sang his infinite tunes then the faun was enraptured and followed far at last the harper was silent and the faun became pan in the midst of the primal forest of eternity thou canst not charm the dolphin with silence o my prophet then the adept was rapt away in bliss and the beyond of bliss and exceeded the excess of excess also his body shook and staggered with the burden of that bliss and that excess and that ultimate nameless they cried he is drunk or he is mad or he is in pain or he is about to die and he heard them not o my lord my beloved how shall i indite songs when even the memory of the shadow of thy glory is a thing beyond all music of speech or of silence behold i am a man even a little child might not endure thee and lo i was alone in a great park and by a certain hillock was a ring of deep enamelled grass wherein green clad ones most beautiful played in their play i came even unto the land of fairy sleep all my thoughts were clad in green most beautiful were they all night they danced and sang but thou art the morning o my darling my serpent that twinest thee about this heart i am the heart and thou the serpent wind thy coils closer about me so that no light nor bliss may penetrate crush out the blood of me as a grape upon the tongue of a white doric girl that languishes with her lover in the moonlight then let the end awake long hast thou slept o great god terminus long ages hast thou waited at the end of the city and the roads thereof awake thou wait no more nay lord but i am come to thee it is i that wait at last the prophet cried against the mountain come thou hither that i may speak with thee the mountain stirred not therefore went the prophet unto the mountain and spake unto it but the feet of the prophet were weary and the mountain heard not his voice but i have called unto thee and i have journeyed unto thee and it availed me not i waited patiently and thou wast with me from the beginning this now i know o my beloved and we are stretched at our ease among the vines but these thy prophets they must cry aloud and scourge themselves they must cross trackless wastes and unfathomed oceans to await thee is the end not the beginning let darkness cover up the writing let the scribe depart among his ways but thou and i are stretched at our ease among the vines what is he o thou beloved one is there not an end nay but there is an end awake arise gird up thy limbs o thou runner bear thou the word unto the mighty cities yea unto the mighty cities iii verily and amen i passed through the deep sea and by the rivers of running water that abound therein and i came unto the land of no desire wherein was a white unicorn with a silver collar whereon was graven the aphorism linea viridis gyrat universa then the word of adonai came unto me by the mouth of the magister mine saying o heart that art girt about with the coils of the old serpent lift up thyself unto the mountain of initiation but i remembered yea than yea theli yea lilith these three were about me from of old for they are one beautiful wast thou o lilith thou serpent woman thou wast lithe and delicious to the taste and thy perfume was of musk mingled with ambergris close didst thou cling with thy coils unto the heart and it was as the joy of all the spring but i beheld in thee a certain taint even in that wherein i delighted i beheld in thee the taint of thy father the ape of thy grandsire the blind worm of slime i gazed upon the crystal of the future and i saw the horror of the end of thee further i destroyed the time past and the time to come had i not the power of the sand glass but in the very hour i beheld corruption then i said o my beloved o lord adonai i pray thee to loosen the coils of the serpent but she was closed fast upon me so that my force was stayed in its inception also i prayed unto the elephant god the lord of beginnings who breaketh down obstruction these gods came right quickly to mine aid i beheld them i joined myself unto them i was lost in their vastness then i beheld myself compassed about with the infinite circle of emerald that encloseth the universe o snake of emerald thou hast no time past no time to come verily thou art not thou art delicious beyond all taste and touch thou art not to be beheld for glory thy voice is beyond the speech and the silence and the speech therein and thy perfume is of pure ambergris that is not weighed against the finest gold of the fine gold also thy coils are of infinite range the heart that thou dost encircle is an universal heart i and me and mine were sitting with lutes in the market place of the great city the city of the violets and the roses the night fell and the music of the lutes was stilled the tempest arose and the music of the lutes was stilled the hour passed and the music of the lutes was stilled but thou art eternity and space thou art matter and motion and thou art the negation of all these things for there is no symbol of thee if i say come up upon the mountains the celestial waters flow at my word but thou art the water beyond the waters the red three angled heart hath been set up in thy shrine for the priests despised equally the shrine and the god yet all the while thou wast hidden therein as the lord of silence is hidden in the buds of the lotus thou art sebek the crocodile against asar thou art mati the slayer in the deep thou art typhon the wrath of the elements o thou who transcendest the forces in their concourse and cohesion in their death and their disruption thou art python the terrible serpent about the end of all things i turned me about thrice in every way and always i came at the last unto thee many things i beheld mediate and immediate but beholding them no more i beheld thee come thou o beloved one o lord god of the universe o vast one o minute one i am thy beloved all day i sing of thy delight all night i delight in thy song there is no other day or night than this thou art beyond the day and the night i am thyself o my maker my master my mate i am like the little red dog that sitteth upon the knees of the unknown thou hast brought me into great delight thou hast given me of thy flesh to eat and of thy blood for an offering of intoxication thou hast fastened the fangs of eternity in my soul and the poison of the infinite hath consumed me utterly i am become like a luscious devil of italy a fair strong woman with worn cheeks eaten out with hunger for kisses she hath played the harlot in divers palaces she hath given her body to the beasts she hath slain her kinsfolk with strong venom of toads she hath been scourged with many rods she hath been broken in pieces upon the wheel the hands of the hangman have bound her unto it the fountains of water have been loosed upon her she hath struggled with exceeding torment she hath burst in sunder with the weight of the waters she hath sunk into the awful sea so am i o adonai my lord and such are the waters of thine intolerable essence so am i o adonai my beloved and thou hast burst me utterly in sunder i am shed out like spilt blood upon the mountains the ravens of dispersion have borne me utterly away therefore is the seal unloosed that guarded the eighth abyss therefore is the vast sea as a veil therefore is there a rending asunder of all things yea also verily thou art the cool still water of the wizard fount i have bathed in thee and lost me in thy stillness that which went in as a brave boy of beautiful limbs cometh forth as a maiden as a little child for perfection o thou light and delight ravish me away into the milky ocean of the stars o thou son of a light transcending mother blessed be thy name and the name of thy name throughout the ages behold i am a butterfly at the source of creation let me die before the hour falling dead into thine infinite

art beautiful and bitter o golden one o my lord adonai o thou abyss of sapphire i follow thee and the waters of death fight strenuously against me i pass unto the waters beyond death and beyond life how shall i answer the foolish man in no way shall he come to the identity of thee but i am the fool that heedeth not the play of the magician me doth the woman of the mysteries instruct in vain i have burst the bonds of love and of power and of worship therefore is the eagle made one with the man and the gallows of infamy dance with the fruit of the just i have descended o my darling into the black shining waters and i have plucked thee forth as a black pearl of infinite preciousness i have gone down o my god into the abyss of the all and i have found thee in the midst under the guise of no thing but as thou art the last thou art also the next and as the next do i reveal thee to the multitude they that ever desired thee shall obtain thee even at the end of their desire glorious glorious glorious art thou o my lover supernal o self of myself for i have found thee alike in the me and the thee there is no difference o my beautiful my desirable one in the one and the many have i found thee yea i have found thee iv o crystal heart i the serpent clasp thee i drive home mine head into the central core of thee o god my beloved even as on the resounding wind swept heights of mitylene some god like woman casts aside the lyre and with her locks aflame as an aureole plunges into the wet heart of the creation so i o lord my god there is a beauty unspeakable in this heart of corruption where the flowers are aflame ah me but the thirst of thy joy parches up this throat so that i cannot sing i will make me a little boat of my tongue and explore the unknown rivers it may be that the everlasting salt may turn to sweetness and that my life may be no longer athirst o ye that drink of the brine of your desire ye are nigh to madness your torture increaseth as ye drink yet still ye drink come up through the creeks to the fresh water i shall be waiting for you with my kisses as the bezoar stone that is found in the belly of the cow so is my lover among lovers o honey boy bring me thy cool limbs hither let us sit awhile in the orchard until the sun go down let us feast on the cool grass bring wine ye slaves that the cheeks of my boy may flush red in the garden of immortal kisses o thou brilliant one shine forth make thy mouth an opium poppy that one kiss is the key to the infinite sleep and lucid the sleep of shi loh am in my sleep i beheld the universe like a clear crystal without one speck there are purse proud penniless ones that stand at the door of the tavern and prate of their feats of wine bibbing there are purse proud penniless ones that stand at the door of the tavern and revile the guests the guests dally upon couches of mother of pearl in the garden the noise of the foolish men is hidden from them only the inn keeper feareth lest the favour of the king be withdrawn from him thus spake the magister v v v v v unto adonai his god as they played together in the starlight over against the deep black pool that is in the holy place of the holy house beneath the altar of the holiest one but adonai laughed and played more languidly then the scribe took note and was glad but adonai had no fear of the magician and his play for it was adonai who had taught all his tricks to the magician and the magister entered into the play of the magician when the magician laughed he laughed all as a man should do and adonai said thou art enmeshed in the web of the magician this he said subtly to try him but the magister gave the sign of the magistry and laughed back on him o lord o beloved did these fingers relax on thy curls or these eyes turn away from thine eye and adonai delighted in him exceedingly yea o my master thou art the beloved of the beloved one the bennu bird is set up in philæ not in vain i who was the priestess of ahathoor rejoice

thou art my darling and my lord and thy poison is sweeter than the kisses of isis the mother of the gods for thou art he yea thou shalt swallow up asi and asar and the children of ptah thou shalt pour forth a flood of poison to destroy the works of the magician only the destroyer shall devour thee thou shalt blacken his throat wherein his spirit abideth ah serpent apep but i love thee my god let thy secret fang pierce to the marrow of the little secret bone that i have kept against the day of vengeance of hoor ra let kheph ra sound his sharded drone let the jackals of day and night howl in the wilderness of time let the towers of the universe totter and the guardians hasten away for my lord hath revealed himself as a mighty serpent and my heart is the blood of his body i am like a love sick courtesan of corinth i have toyed with kings and captains and made them my slaves to day i am the slave of the little asp of death and who shall loosen our love weary weary saith the scribe who shall lead me to the sight of the rapture of my master the body is weary and the soul is sore weary and sleep weighs down their eyelids yet ever abides the sure consciousness of ecstasy unknown yet known in that its being is certain o lord be my helper and bring me to the bliss of the beloved i came to the house of the beloved and the wine was like fire that flieth with green wings through the world of waters i felt the red lips of nature and the black lips of perfection like sisters they fondled me their little brother they decked me out as a bride they mounted me for thy bridal chamber they fled away at thy coming i was alone before thee i trembled at thy coming o my god for thy messenger was more terrible than the death star on the threshold stood the fulminant figure of evil the horror of emptiness with his ghastly eyes like poisonous wells he stood and the chamber was corrupt the air stank he was an old and gnarled fish more hideous than the shells of abaddon he enveloped me with his demon tentacles yea the eight fears took hold upon me but i was anointed with the right sweet oil of the magister i slipped from the embrace as a stone from the sling of a boy of the woodlands i was smooth and hard as ivory the horror gat no hold then at the noise of the wind of thy coming he was dissolved away and the abyss of the great void was unfolded before me across the waveless sea of eternity thou didst ride with thy captains and thy hosts with thy chariots and horsemen and spearmen didst thou travel through the blue before i saw thee thou wast already with me i was smitten through by thy marvellous spear i was stricken as a bird by the bolt of the thunderer i was pierced as the thief by the lord of the garden o my lord let us sail upon the sea of blood there is a deep taint beneath the ineffable bliss it is the taint of generation yea though the flower wave bright in the sunshine the root is deep in the darkness of earth praise to thee o beautiful dark earth thou art the mother of a million myriads of myriads of flowers also i beheld my god and the countenance of him was a thousandfold brighter than the lightning yet in his heart i beheld the slow and dark one the ancient one the devourer of his children in the height and the abyss o my beautiful there is no thing verily there is no thing at all that is not altogether and perfectly fashioned for thy delight light cleaveth unto light and filth to filth with pride one contemneth another but not thou who art all and beyond it who art absolved from the division of the shadows o day of eternity let thy wave break in foamless glory of sapphire upon the laborious coral of our making we have made us a ring of glistening white sand strewn wisely in the midst of the delightful ocean let the palms of brilliance flower upon our island we shall eat of their fruit and be glad but for me the lustral water the great ablution the dissolving of the soul in that resounding abyss i have a little son like a wanton goat my daughter is like an unfledged eaglet they shall get them fins that they may swim that they may swim o my beloved swim far in the warm honey of thy being o blessed one o boy of beatitude this heart of mine is girt about with the serpent that devoureth his own coils when shall there be an end o my darling o when shall the universe and the lord thereof be utterly swallowed up nay who shall devour the infinite who shall undo the wrong of the beginning thou criest like a white cat upon the roof of the universe there is none to answer thee thou art like a lonely pillar in the midst of the sea there is none to behold thee o thou who beholdest all thou dost faint thou dost fail thou scribe cried the desolate voice but i have filled thee with a wine whose savour thou knowest not it shall avail to make drunken the people of the old gray sphere that rolls in the infinite far off they shall lap the wine as dogs that lap the blood of a beautiful courtesan pierced through by the spear of a swift rider through the city i too am the soul of the desert thou shalt seek me yet again in the wilderness of sand at thy right hand a great lord and a comely at thy left hand a woman clad in gossamer and gold and having the stars in her hair ye shall journey far into a land of pestilence and evil ye shall encamp in the river of a foolish city forgotten there shall ye meet with me there will i make mine habitation as for bridal will i come bedecked and anointed there shall the consummation be accomplished o my darling i also wait for the brilliance of the hour ineffable when the universe shall be like a girdle for the midst of the ray of our love extending beyond the permitted end of the endless one then o thou heart will i the serpent eat thee wholly up yea i will eat thee wholly up v ah my lord adonai that dalliest with the magister in the treasure house of pearls let me listen to the echo of your kisses is not the starry heaven shaken as a leaf at the tremulous rapture of your love am not i the flying spark of light whirled away by the great wind of your perfection yea cried the holy one and from thy spark will i the lord kindle a great light i will burn through the grey city in the old and desolate land i will cleanse it from its great impurity and thou o prophet shalt see these things and thou shalt heed them not now is the pillar established in the void now is asi fulfilled of asar now is hoor let down into the animal soul of things like a fiery star that falleth upon the darkness of the earth through the midnight thou art dropt o my child my conqueror my sword girt captain o hoor and they shall find thee as a black gnarl d glittering stone and they shall worship thee my prophet shall prophesy concerning thee around thee the maidens shall dance and bright babes be born unto them thou shalt inspire the proud ones with infinite pride and the humble ones with an ecstasy of abasement all this shall transcend the known and the unknown with somewhat that hath no name for it is as the abyss of the arcanum that is opened in the secret place of silence thou hast come hither o my prophet through grave paths thou hast eaten of the dung of the abominable ones thou hast prostrated thyself before the goat and the crocodile the evil men have made thee a plaything thou hast wandered as a painted harlot ravishing with sweet scent and chinese colouring in the streets thou hast darkened thine eyepits with kohl thou hast tinted thy lips with vermilion thou hast plastered thy cheeks with ivory enamels thou hast played the wanton in every gate and by way of the great city the men of the city have lusted after thee to abuse thee and to beat thee they have mouthed the golden spangles of fine dust wherewith thou didst bedeck thine hair they have scourged the painted flesh of thee with their whips thou hast suffered unspeakable things but i have burnt within thee as a pure flame without oil in the midnight i was brighter than the moon in the daytime i exceeded utterly the sun in the byways of thy being i flamed and dispelled the illusion therefore thou art wholly pure before me therefore thou art my virgin unto eternity therefore i love thee with surpassing love therefore they that despise thee shall adore thee thou shalt be lovely and pitiful toward them thou shalt heal them of the unutterable evil they shall change in their destruction even as two dark stars that crash together in the abyss and blaze up in an infinite burning all this while did adonai pierce my being with his sword that hath four blades the blade of the thunderbolt the blade of the pylon the blade of the serpent the blade of the phallus also he taught me the holy unutterable word ararita so that i melted the sixfold gold into a single invisible point whereof naught may be spoken for the magistry of this opus is a secret magistry and the sign of the master thereof is a certain ring of lapis lazuli with the name of my master who am i and the eye in the midst thereof also he spake and said this is a secret sign and thou shalt not disclose it unto the profane nor unto the neophyte nor unto the zelator nor unto the practicus nor unto the philosophus nor unto the lesser adept nor unto the greater adept but unto the exempt adept thou shalt disclose thyself if thou have need of him for the lesser operations of thine art accept the worship of the foolish people whom thou hatest the fire is not defiled by the altars of the ghebers nor is the moon contaminated by the incense of them that adore the queen of night thou shalt dwell among the people as a precious diamond among cloudy diamonds and crystals and pieces of glass only the eye of the just merchant shall behold thee and plunging in his hand shall single thee out and glorify thee before men but thou shalt heed none of this thou shalt be ever the heart and i the serpent will coil close about thee my coil shall never relax throughout the æons neither change nor sorrow nor unsubstantiality shall have thee for thou art passed beyond all these even as the diamond shall glow red for the rose and green for the rose leaf so shalt thou abide apart from the impressions i am thou and the pillar is stablished in the void also thou art beyond the stabilities of being and of consciousness and of bliss for i am thou and the pillar is stablished in the void also thou shalt discourse of these things unto the man that writeth them and he shall partake of them as a sacrament for i who am thou am he and the pillar is stablished in the void from the crown to the abyss so goeth it single and erect also the limitless sphere shall glow with the brilliance thereof thou shalt rejoice in the pools of adorable water thou shalt bedeck thy damsels with pearls of fecundity thou shalt light flame like licking tongues of liquor of the gods between the pools also thou shalt convert the all sweeping air into the winds of pale water thou shalt transmute the earth into a blue abyss of wine ruddy are the gleams of ruby and gold that sparkle therein one drop shall intoxicate the lord of the gods my servant also adonai spake unto v v v v v saying o my little one my tender one my little amorous one my gazelle my beautiful my boy let us fill up the pillar of the infinite with an infinite kiss so that the stable was shaken and the unstable became still they that beheld it cried with a formidable affright the end of things is come upon us and it was even so also i was in the spirit vision and beheld a parricidal pomp of atheists coupled by two and by two in the supernal ecstasy of the stars they did laugh and rejoice exceedingly being clad in purple robes and drunken with purple wine and their whole soul was one purple flower flame of holiness they beheld not god they beheld not the image of god therefore were they arisen to the palace of the splendour ineffable a sharp sword smote out before them and the worm hope writhed in its death agony under their feet even as their rapture shore asunder the visible hope so also the fear invisible fled away and was no more o ye that are beyond aormuzdi and ahrimanes blessèd are ye unto the ages they shaped doubt as a sickle and reaped the flowers of faith for their garlands they shaped ecstasy as a spear and pierced the ancient dragon that sat upon the stagnant water then the fresh springs were unloosed that the folk athirst might be at ease and again i was caught up into the presence of my lord adonai and the knowledge and conversation of the holy one the angel that guardeth me o holy exalted one o self beyond self o self luminous image of the unimaginable naught o my darling my beautiful come thou forth and follow me adonai divine adonai let adonai initiate refulgent dalliance thus i concealed the name of her name that inspireth my rapture the scent of whose body bewildereth the soul the light of whose soul abaseth this body unto the beasts i have sucked out the blood with my lips i have drained her beauty of its sustenance i have abased her before me i have mastered her i have possessed her and her life is within me in her blood i inscribe the secret riddles of the sphinx of the gods that none shall understand save only the pure and voluptuous the chaste and obscene the androgyne and the gynander that have passed beyond the bars of the prison that the old slime of khem set up in the gates of amennti o my adorable my delicious one all night will i pour out the libation on thine altars all night will i burn the sacrifice of blood all night will i swing the thurible of my delight before thee and the fervour of the orisons shall intoxicate thy nostrils o thou who camest from the land of the elephant girt about with the tiger s pell and garlanded with the lotus of the spirit do thou inebriate my life with thy madness that she leap at my passing bid thy maidens who follow thee bestrew us a bed of flowers immortal that we may take our pleasure thereupon bid thy satyrs heap thorns among the flowers that we may take our pain thereupon let the pleasure and pain be mingled in one supreme offering unto the lord adonai also i heard the voice of adonai the lord the desirable one concerning that which is beyond let not the dwellers in thebai and the temples thereof prate ever of the pillars of hercules and the ocean of the west is not the nile a beautiful water let not the priest of isis uncover the nakedness of nuit for every step is a death and a birth the priest of isis lifted the veil of isis and was slain by the kisses of her mouth then was he the priest of nuit and drank of the milk of the stars let not the failure and the pain turn aside the worshippers the foundations of the pyramid were hewn in the living rock ere sunset did the king weep at dawn that the crown of the pyramid was yet unquarried in the distant land there was also an humming bird that spake unto the horned cerastes and prayed him for poison and the great snake of khem the holy one the royal uræus serpent answered him and said i sailed over the sky of nu in the car called millions of years and i saw not any creature upon seb that was equal to me the venom of my fang is the inheritance of my father and of my father s father and how shall i give it unto thee live thou and thy children as i and my fathers have lived even unto an hundred millions of generations and it may be that the mercy of the mighty ones may bestow upon thy children a drop of the poison of eld then the humming bird was afflicted in his spirit and he flew unto the flowers and it was as if naught had been spoken between them yet in a little while a serpent struck him that he died but an ibis that meditated upon the bank of nile the beautiful god listened and heard and he laid aside his ibis ways and became as a serpent saying peradventure in an hundred millions of millions of generations of my children they shall attain to a drop of the poison of the fang of the exalted one and behold ere the moon waxed thrice he became an uræus serpent and the poison of the fang was established in him and his seed even for ever and for ever o thou serpent apep my lord adonai it is a speck of minutest time this travelling through eternity and in thy sight the landmarks are of fair white marble untouched by the tool of the graver therefore thou art mine even now and for ever and for everlasting amen moreover i heard the voice of adonai seal up the book of the heart and the serpent in the number five and sixty seal thou the holy book as fine gold that is beaten into a diadem for the fair queen of pharaoh as great stones that are cemented together into the pyramid of the ceremony of the death of asar so do thou bind together the words and the deeds so that in all is one thought of me thy delight adonai and i answered and said it is done even according unto thy word and it was done and they that read the book and debated thereon passed into the desolate land of barren words and they that sealed up the book into their blood were the chosen of adonai and the thought of adonai was a word and a deed and they abode in the land that the far off travellers call naught o land beyond honey and spice and all perfection i will dwell therein with my lord for ever and the lord adonai delighteth in me and i bear the cup of his gladness unto the weary ones of the old grey land they that drink thereof are smitten of disease the abomination hath hold upon them and their torment is like the thick black smoke of the evil abode but the chosen ones drank thereof and became even as my lord my beautiful my desirable one there is no wine like unto this wine they are gathered together into a glowing heart as ra that gathereth his clouds about him at eventide into a molten sea of joy and the snake that is the crown of ra bindeth them about with the golden girdle of the death kisses so also is the end of the book and the lord adonai is about it on all sides like a thunderbolt and a pylon and a snake and a phallus and in the midst thereof he is like the woman that jetteth out the milk of the stars from her paps yea the milk of the stars from her paps";

tribulation of ordeal which is bliss the fool readeth this book of the law and its comment & he understandeth it not let him come through the first ordeal & it will be to him as silver through the second gold through the third stones of precious water through the fourth ultimate sparks of the intimate fire yet to all it shall seem beautiful its enemies who say not so are mere liars there is success i am the hawk-headed lord of silence & of strength my nemyss shrouds the night-blue sky hail ye twin warriors about the pillars of the world for your time is nigh at hand i am the lord of the double wand of power the wand of the force of coph nia but my left hand is empty for i have crushed an universe & nought remains paste the sheets from right to left and from top to bottom then behold

enumeration = "chapter i 1. had! the manifestation of nuit. 2. the unveiling of the company of heaven. 3. every man and every woman is a star. 4. every number is infinite; there is no difference. 5. help me, o warrior lord of thebes, in my unveiling before the children of men! 6. be thou hadit, my secret centre, my heart & my tongue! 7. behold! it is revealed by aiwass the minister of hoor-paar-kraat. 8. the khabs is in the khu, not the khu in the khabs. 9. worship then the khabs, and behold my light shed over you! 10. let my servants be few & secret: they shall rule the many & the known. 11. these are fools that men adore; both their gods & their men are fools. 12. come forth, o children, under the stars, & take your fill of love! 13. i am above you and in you. my ecstasy is in yours. my joy is to see your joy. 14. above, the gemmed azure is the naked splendour of nuit; she bends in ecstasy to kiss the secret ardours of hadit. the winged globe, the starry blue, are mine, o ankh-af-na-khonsu! 15. now ye shall know that the chosen priest & apostle of infinite space is the prince-priest the beast; and in his woman called the scarlet woman is all power given. they shall gather my children into their fold: they shall bring the glory of the stars into the hearts of men. 16. for he is ever a sun, and she a moon. but to him is the winged secret flame, and to her the stooping starlight. 17. but ye are not so chosen. 18. burn upon their brows, o splendrous serpent! 19. o azure-lidded woman, bend upon them! 20. the key of the rituals is in the secret word which i have given unto him. 21. with the god & the adorer i am nothing: they do not see me. they are as upon the earth; i am heaven, and there is no other god than me, and my lord hadit. 22. now, therefore, i am known to ye by my name nuit, and to him by a secret name which i will give him when at last he knoweth me. since i am infinite space, and the infinite stars thereof, do ye also thus. bind nothing! let there be no difference made among you between any one thing & any other thing; for thereby there cometh hurt. 23. but whoso availeth in this, let him be the chief of all! 24. i am nuit, and my word is six and fifty. 25. divide, add, multiply, and understand. 26. then saith the prophet and slave of the beauteous one: who am i, and what shall be the sign? so she answered him, bendingdown, a lambent flame of blue, all-touching, all penetrant, her lovely hands upon the black earth, & her lithe body arched for love, and her soft feet not hurting the little flowers: thou knowest! and the sign shall be my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuity of existence, the omnipresence of my body. 27. then the priest answered & said unto the queen of space, kissing her lovely brows, and the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfume of sweat: o nuit, continuous one of heaven, let it be ever thus; that men speak not of thee as one but as none; and let them speak not of thee at all, since thou art continuous! 28. none, breathed the light, faint & faery, of the stars, and two. 29. for i am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union. 30. this is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all. 31. for these fools of men and their woes care not thou at all! they feel little; what is, is balanced by weak joys; but ye are my chosen ones. 32. obey my prophet! follow out the ordeals of my knowledge! seek me only! then the joys of my love will redeem ye from all pain. this is so: i swear it by the vault of my body; by my sacred heart and tongue; by all i can give, by all i desire of ye all. 33. then the priest fell into a deep trance or swoon, & said unto the queen of heaven; write unto us the ordeals; write unto us the rituals; write unto us the law! 34. but she said: the ordeals i write not: the rituals shall be half known and half concealed: the law is for all. 35. this that thou writest is the threefold book of law. 36. my scribe ankh-af-na-khonsu, the priest of the princes, shall not in one letter change this book; but lest there be folly, he shall comment thereupon by the wisdom of ra-hoor-khuit. 37. also the mantras and spells; the obeah and the wanga; the work of the wand and the work of the sword; these he shall learn and teach. 38. he must teach; but he may make severe the ordeals. 39. the word of the law is θελημα. 40. who calls us thelemites will do no wrong, if he look but close into the word. for there are therein three grades, the hermit, and the lover, and the man of earth. do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. 41. the word of sin is restriction. o man! refuse not thy wife, if she will! o lover, if thou wilt, depart! there is no bond that can unite the divided but love: all else is a curse. accursed! accursed be it to the aeons! hell. 42. let it be that state of manyhood bound and loathing. so with thy all; thou hast no right but to do thy will. 43. do that, and no other shall say nay. 44. for pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect. 45. the perfect and the perfect are one perfect and not two; nay, are none! 46. nothing is a secret key of this law. sixty-one the jews call it; i call it eight, eighty, four hundred & eighteen. 47. but they have the half: unite by thine art so that all disappear. 48. my prophet is a fool with his one, one, one; are not they the ox, and none by the book? 49. abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs. ra-hoor-khuit hath taken his seat in the east at the equinox of the gods; and let asar be with isa, who also are one. but they are not of me. let asar be the adorant, isa the sufferer; hoor in his secret name and splendour is the lord initiating. 50. there is a word to say about the hierophantic task. behold! there are three ordeals in one, and it may be given in three ways. the gross must pass through fire; let the fine be tried in intellect, and the lofty chosen ones in the highest. thus ye have star & star, system & system; let not one know well the other! 51. there are four gates to one palace; the floor of that palace is of silver and gold; lapis lazuli & jasper are there; and all rare scents; jasmine & rose, and the emblems of death. let him enter in turn or at once the four gates; let him stand on the floor of the palace. will he not sink? amn. ho! warrior, if thy servant sink? but there are means and means. be goodly therefore: dress ye all in fine apparel; eat rich foods and drink sweet wines and wines that foam! also, take your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where and with whom ye will! but always unto me. 52. if this be not aright; if ye confound the space-marks, saying: they are one; or saying, they are many; if the ritual be not ever unto me: then expect the direful judgments of ra hoor khuit! 53. this shall regenerate the world, the little world my sister, my heart & my tongue, unto whom i send this kiss. also, o scribe and prophet, though thou be of the princes, it shall not assuage thee nor absolve thee. but ecstasy be thine and joy of earth: ever to me! to me! 54. change not as much as the style of a letter; for behold! thou, o prophet, shalt not behold all these mysteries hidden therein. 55. the child of thy bowels, he shall behold them. 56. expect him not from the east, nor from the west; for from no expected house cometh that child. aum! all words are sacred and all prophets true; save only that they understand a little; solve the first half of the equation, leave the second unattacked. but thou hast all in the clear light, and some, though not all, in the dark. 57. invoke me under my stars! love is the law, love under will. nor let the fools mistake love; for there are love and love. there is the dove, and there is the serpent. choose ye well! he, my prophet, hath chosen, knowing the law of the fortress, and the great mystery of the house of god. all these old letters of my book are aright; but צ is not the star. this also is secret: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise. 58. i give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do i demand aught in sacrifice. 59. my incense is of resinous woods & gums; and there is no blood therein: because of my hair the trees of eternity. 60. my number is 11, as all their numbers who are of us. the five pointed star, with a circle in the middle, & the circle is red. my colour is black to the blind, but the blue & gold are seen of the seeing. also i have a secret glory for them that love me. 61. but to love me is better than all things: if under the night stars in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking me with a pure heart, and the serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom. for one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all; but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose all in that hour. ye shall gather goods and store of women and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations of the earth in splendour & pride; but always in the love of me, and so shall ye come to my joy. i charge you earnestly to come before me in a single robe, and covered with a rich headdress. i love you! i yearn to you! pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous, i who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desire you. put on the wings, and arouse the coiled splendour within you: come unto me! 62. at all my meetings with you shall the priestess say -- and her eyes shall burn with desire as she stands bare and rejoicing in my secret temple -- to me! to me! calling forth the flame of the hearts of all in her love-chant. 63. sing the rapturous love-song unto me! burn to me perfumes! wear to me jewels! drink to me, for i love you! i love you! 64. i am the blue-lidded daughter of sunset; i am the naked brilliance of the voluptuous night-sky. 65. to me! to me! 66. the manifestation of nuit is at an end. chapter ii 1. nu! the hiding of hadit. 2. come! all ye, and learn the secret that hath not yet been revealed. i, hadit, am the complement of nu, my bride. i am not extended, and khabs is the name of my house. 3. in the sphere i am everywhere the centre, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found. 4. yet she shall be known & i never. 5. behold! the rituals of the old time are black. let the evil ones be cast away; let the good ones be purged by the prophet! then shall this knowledge go aright. 6. i am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star. i am life, and the giver of life, yet therefore is the knowledge of me the knowledge of death. 7. i am the magician and the exorcist. i am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. \"come unto me\" is a foolish word: for it is i that go. 8. who worshipped heru-pa-kraath have worshipped me; ill, for i am the worshipper. 9. remember all ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but as shadows; they pass & are done; but there is that which remains. 10. o prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writing. 11. i see thee hate the hand & the pen; but i am stronger. 12. because of me in thee which thou knewest not. 13. for why? because thou wast the knower, and me. 14. now let there be a veiling of this shrine: now let the light devour men and eat them up with blindness! 15. for i am perfect, being not; and my number is nine by the fools; but with the just i am eight, and one in eight: which is vital, for i am none indeed. the empress and the king are not of me; for there is a further secret. 16. i am the empress & the hierophant. thus eleven, as my bride is eleven. 17. hear me, ye people of sighing! the sorrows of pain and regret are left to the dead and the dying, the folk that not know me as yet. 18. these are dead, these fellows; they feel not. we are not for the poor and sad: the lords of the earth are our kinsfolk. 19. is a god to live in a dog? no! but the highest are of us. they shall rejoice, our chosen: who sorroweth is not of us. 20. beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and fire, are of us. 21. we have nothing with the outcast and the unfit: let them die in their misery. for they feel not. compassion is the vice of kings: stamp down the wretched & the weak: this is the law of the strong: this is our law and the joy of the world. think not, o king, upon that lie: that thou must die: verily thou shalt not die, but live. now let it be understood: if the body of the king dissolve, he shall remain in pure ecstasy for ever. nuit! hadit! ra-hoor-khuit! the sun, strength & sight, light; these are for the servants of the star & the snake. 22. i am the snake that giveth knowledge & delight and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness. to worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof i will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof! they shall not harm ye at all. it is a lie, this folly against self. the exposure of innocence is a lie. be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that any god shall deny thee for this. 23. i am alone: there is no god where i am. 24. behold! these be grave mysteries; for there are also of my friends who be hermits. now think not to find them in the forest or on the mountain; but in beds of purple, caressed by magnificent beasts of women with large limbs, and fire and light in their eyes, and masses of flaming hair about them; there shall ye find them. ye shall see them at rule, at victorious armies, at all the joy; and there shall be in them a joy a million times greater than this. beware lest any force another, king against king! love one another with burning hearts; on the low men trample in the fierce lust of your pride, in the day of your wrath. 25. ye are against the people, o my chosen! 26. i am the secret serpent coiled about to spring: in my coiling there is joy. if i lift up my head, i and my nuit are one. if i droop down mine head, and shoot forth venom, then is rapture of the earth, and i and the earth are one. 27. there is great danger in me; for who doth not understand these runes shall make a great miss. he shall fall down into the pit called because, and there he shall perish with the dogs of reason. 28. now a curse upon because and his kin! 29. may because be accursed for ever! 30. if will stops and cries why, invoking because, then will stops & does nought. 31. if power asks why, then is power weakness. 32. also reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite & unknown; & all their words are skew-wise. 33. enough of because! be he damned for a dog! 34. but ye, o my people, rise up & awake! 35. let the rituals be rightly performed with joy & beauty! 36. there are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times. 37. a feast for the first night of the prophet and his bride! 38. a feast for the three days of the writing of the book of the law. 39. a feast for tahuti and the child of the prophet--secret, o prophet! 40. a feast for the supreme ritual, and a feast for the equinox of the gods. 41. a feast for fire and a feast for water; a feast for life and a greater feast for death! 42. a feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture! 43. a feast every night unto nu, and the pleasure of uttermost delight! 44. aye! feast! rejoice! there is no dread hereafter. there is the dissolution, and eternal ecstasy in the kisses of nu. 45. there is death for the dogs. 46. dost thou fail? art thou sorry? is fear in thine heart? 47. where i am these are not. 48. pity not the fallen! i never knew them. i am not for them. i console not: i hate the consoled & the consoler. 49. i am unique & conqueror. i am not of the slaves that perish. be they damned & dead! amen. (this is of the 4: there is a fifth who is invisible, & therein am i as a babe in an egg.) 50. blue am i and gold in the light of my bride: but the red gleam is in my eyes; & my spangles are purple & green. 51. purple beyond purple: it is the light higher than eyesight. 52. there is a veil: that veil is black. it is the veil of the modest woman; it is the veil of sorrow, & the pall of death: this is none of me. tear down that lying spectre of the centuries: veil not your vices in virtuous words: these vices are my service; ye do well, & i will reward you here and hereafter. 53. fear not, o prophet, when these words are said, thou shalt not be sorry. thou art emphatically my chosen; and blessed are the eyes that thou shalt look upon with gladness. but i will hide thee in a mask of sorrow: they that see thee shall fear thou art fallen: but i lift thee up. 54. nor shall they who cry aloud their folly that thou meanest nought avail; thou shall reveal it: thou availest: they are the slaves of because: they are not of me. the stops as thou wilt; the letters? change them not in style or value! 55. thou shalt obtain the order & value of the english alphabet; thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto. 56. begone! ye mockers; even though ye laugh in my honour ye shall laugh not long: then when ye are sad know that i have forsaken you. 57. he that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that is filthy shall be filthy still. 58. yea! deem not of change: ye shall be as ye are, & not other. therefore the kings of the earth shall be kings for ever: the slaves shall serve. there is none that shall be cast down or lifted up: all is ever as it was. yet there are masked ones my servants: it may be that yonder beggar is a king. a king may choose his garment as he will: there is no certain test: but a beggar cannot hide his poverty. 59. beware therefore! love all, lest perchance is a king concealed! say you so? fool! if he be a king, thou canst not hurt him. 60. therefore strike hard & low, and to hell with them, master! 61. there is a light before thine eyes, o prophet, a light undesired, most desirable. 62. i am uplifted in thine heart; and the kisses of the stars rain hard upon thy body. 63. thou art exhaust in the voluptuous fullness of the inspiration; the expiration is sweeter than death, more rapid and laughterful than a caress of hell's own worm. 64. oh! thou art overcome: we are upon thee; our delight is all over thee: hail! hail: prophet of nu! prophet of had! prophet of ra-hoor-khu! now rejoice! now come in our splendour & rapture! come in our passionate peace, & write sweet words for the kings. 65. i am the master: thou art the holy chosen one. 66. write, & find ecstasy in writing! work, & be our bed in working! thrill with the joy of life & death! ah! thy death shall be lovely: whososeeth it shall be glad. thy death shall be the seal of the promise of our age long love. come! lift up thine heart & rejoice! we are one; we are none. 67. hold! hold! bear up in thy rapture; fall not in swoon of the excellent kisses! 68. harder! hold up thyself! lift thine head! breathe not so deep -- die! 69. ah! ah! what do i feel? is the word exhausted? 70. there is help & hope in other spells. wisdom says: be strong! then canst thou bear more joy. be not animal; refine thy rapture! if thou drink, drink by the eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed by delicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, let there be subtlety therein! 71. but exceed! exceed! 72. strive ever to more! and if thou art truly mine -- and doubt it not, an if thou art ever joyous! -- death is the crown of all. 73. ah! ah! death! death! thou shalt long for death. death is forbidden, o man, unto thee. 74. the length of thy longing shall be the strength of its glory. he that lives long & desires death much is ever the king among the kings. 75. aye! listen to the numbers & the words: 76. 4 6 3 8 a b k 2 4 a l g m o r 3 y x 24 89 r p s t o v a l. what meaneth this, o prophet? thou knowest not; nor shalt thou know ever. there cometh one to follow thee: he shall expound it. but remember, o chose none, to be me; to follow the love of nu in the star-lit heaven; to look forth upon men, to tell them this glad word. 77. o be thou proud and mighty among men! 78. lift up thyself! for there is none like unto thee among men or among gods! lift up thyself, o my prophet, thy stature shall surpass the stars. they shall worship thy name, foursquare, mystic, wonderful, the number of the man; and the name of thy house 418. 79. the end of the hiding of hadit; and blessing & worship to the prophet of the lovely star! chapter iii 1. abrahadabra; the reward of ra hoor khut. 2. there is division hither homeward; there is a word not known. spelling is defunct; all is not aught. beware! hold! raise the spell of ra-hoor-khuit! 3. now let it be first understood that i am a god of war and of vengeance. i shall deal hardly with them. 4. choose ye an island! 5. fortify it! 6. dung it about with enginery of war! 7. i will give you a war-engine. 8. with it ye shall smite the peoples; and none shall stand before you. 9. lurk! withdraw! upon them! this is the law of the battle of conquest: thus shall my worship be about my secret house. 10. get the stele of revealing itself; set it in thy secret temple -- and that temple is already aright disposed -- & it shall be your kiblah for ever. it shall not fade, but miraculous colour shall come back to it day after day. close it in locked glass for a proof to the world. 11. this shall be your only proof. i forbid argument. conquer! that is enough. i will make easy to you the abstruction from the ill-ordered house in the victorious city. thou shalt thyself convey it with worship, o prophet, though thou likest it not. thou shalt have danger & trouble. ra-hoor-khu is with thee. worship me with fire & blood; worship me with swords & with spears. let the woman be girt with a sword before me: let blood flow to my name. trample down the heathen; be upon them, o warrior, i will give you of their flesh to eat! 12. sacrifice cattle, little and big: after a child. 13. but not now. 14. ye shall see that hour, o blessed beast, and thou the scarlet concubine of his desire! 15. ye shall be sad thereof. 16. deem not too eagerly to catch the promises; fear not to undergo the curses. ye, even ye, know not this meaning all. 17. fear not at all; fear neither men nor fates, nor gods, nor anything. money fear not, nor laughter of the folk folly, nor any other power in heaven or upon the earth or under the earth. nu is your refuge as hadit your light; and i am the strength, force, vigour, of your arms. 18. mercy let be off; damn them who pity! kill and torture; spare not; be upon them! 19. that stele they shall call the abomination of desolation; count well its name, & it shall be to you as 718. 20. why? because of the fall of because, that he is not there again. 21. set up my image in the east: thou shalt buy thee an image which i will show thee, especial, not unlike the one thou knowest. and it shall be suddenly easy for thee to do this. 22. the other images group around me to support me: let all be worshipped, for they shall cluster to exalt me. i am the visible object of worship; the others are secret; for the beast & his bride are they: and for the winners of the ordeal x. what is this? thou shalt know. 23. for perfume mix meal & honey & thick leavings of red wine: then oil of abramelin and olive oil, and afterward soften & smooth down with rich fresh blood. 24. the best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child, or dropping from the host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers: last of some beast, no matter what. 25. this burn: of this make cakes & eat unto me. this hath also another use; let it be laid before me, and kept thick with perfumes of your orison: it shall become full of beetles as it were and creeping things sacred unto me. 26. these slay, naming your enemies; & they shall fall before you. 27. also these shall breed lust & power of lust in you at the eating thereof. 28. also ye shall be strong in war. 29. moreover, be they long kept, it is better; for they swell with my force. all before me. 30. my altar is of open brass work: burn thereon in silver or gold! 31. there cometh a rich man from the west who shall pour his gold upon thee. 32. from gold forge steel! 33. be ready to fly or to smite! 34. but your holy place shall be untouched throughout the centuries: though with fire and sword it be burnt down & shattered, yet an invisible house there standeth, and shall stand until the fall of the great equinox; when hrumachis shall arise and the double-wanded one assume my throne and place. another prophet shall arise, and bring fresh fever from the skies; another woman shall awakethe lust & worship of the snake; another soul of god and beast shall mingle in the globed priest; another sacrifice shall stain the tomb; another king shall reign; and blessing no longer be poured to the hawk-headed mystical lord! 35. the half of the word of heru-ra-ha, called hoor-pa-kraat and ra-hoor-khut. 36. then said the prophet unto the god: 37. i adore thee in the song -- i am the lord of thebes, and i the inspired forth-speaker of mentu; for me unveils the veiled sky, the self-slain ankh-af-na-khonsu whose words are truth. i invoke, i greet thy presence, o ra-hoor-khuit! unity uttermost showed! i adore the might of thy breath, supreme and terrible god, who makest the gods and death to tremble before thee: -- i, i adore thee! appear on the throne of ra! open the ways of the khu! lighten the ways of the ka! the ways of the khabs run through to stir me or still me! aum! let it fill me! 38. so that thy light is in me; & its red flame is as a sword in my hand to push thy order. there is a secret door that i shall make to establish thy way in all the quarters, (these are the adorations, as thou hast written), as it is said: the light is mine; its rays consume me: i have made a secret door into the house of ra and tum, of khephra and of ahathoor. i am thy theban, o mentu, the prophet ankh-af-na-khonsu! by bes-na-maut my breast i beat; by wise ta-nech i weave my spell. show thy star-splendour, o nuit! bid me within thine house to dwell, o winged snake of light, hadit! abide with me, ra-hoor-khuit! 39. all this and a book to say how thou didst come hither and a reproduction of this ink and paper for ever -- for in it is the word secret & not only in the english -- and thy comment upon this the book of the law shall be printed beautifully in red ink and black upon beautiful paper made by hand; and to each man and woman that thou meetest, were it but to dine or to drink at them, it is the law to give. then they shall chance to abide in this bliss or no; it is no odds. do this quickly! 40. but the work of the comment? that is easy; and hadit burning in thy heart shall make swift and secure thy pen. 41. establish at thy kaaba a clerk-house: all must be done well and with business way. 42. the ordeals thou shalt oversee thyself, save only the blind ones. refuse none, but thou shalt know & destroy the traitors. i am ra-hoor-khuit; and i am powerful to protect my servant. success is thy proof: argue not; convert not; talk not over much! them that seek to entrap thee, to overthrow thee, them attack without pity or quarter; & destroy them utterly. swift as a trodden serpent turn and strike! be thou yet deadlier than he! drag down their souls to awful torment: laugh at their fear: spit upon them! 43. let the scarlet woman beware! if pity and compassion and tenderness visit her heart; if she leave my work to toy with old sweetnesses; then shall my vengeance be known. i will slay me her child: i will alienate her heart: i will cast her out from men: as a shrinking and despised harlot shall she crawl through dusk wet streets, and die cold and an-hungered.44. but let her raise herself in pride! let her follow me in my way! let her work the work of wickedness! let her kill her heart! let her be loud and adulterous! let her be covered with jewels, and rich garments, and let her be shameless before all men! 45. then will i lift her to pinnacles of power: then will i breed from her a child mightier than all the kings of the earth. i will fill her with joy: with my force shall she see & strike at the worship of nu: she shall achieve hadit. 46. i am the warrior lord of the forties: the eighties cower before me, & are abased. i will bring you to victory & joy: i will be at your arms in battle & ye shall delight to slay. success is your proof; courage is your armour; go on, go on, in my strength; & ye shall turn not back for any! 47. this book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with the original in the writing of the beast; for in the chance shape of the letters and their position to one another: in these are mysteries that no beast shall divine. let him not seek to try: but one cometh after him, whence i say not, who shall discover the key of it all. then this line drawn is a key: then this circle squared in its failure is a key also. and abrahadabra. it shall be his child & that strangely. let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall from it. 48. now this mystery of the letters is done, and i want to go on to the holier place. 49. i am in a secret fourfold word, the blasphemy against all gods of men. 50. curse them! curse them! curse them! 51. with my hawk's head i peck at the eyes of jesus as he hangs upon the cross. 52. i flap my wings in the face of mohammed & blind him. 53. with my claws i tear out the flesh of the indian and the buddhist, mongol and din. 54. bahlasti! ompehda! i spit on your crapulous creeds.55. let mary inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women be utterly despised among you! 56. also for beauty's sake and love's! 57. despise also all cowards; professiona soldiers who dare not fight, but play; all fools despise! 58. but the keen and the proud, the royal and the lofty; ye are brothers! 59. as brothers fight ye! 60. there is no law beyond do what thou wilt. 61. there is an end of the word of the god enthroned in ra's seat, lightening the girders of the soul. 62. to me do ye reverence! to me come ye through tribulation of ordeal, which is bliss. 63. the fool readeth this book of the law, and its comment; & he understandeth it not. 64. let him come through the first ordeal, & it will be to him as silver. 65. through the second, gold. 66. through the third, stones of precious water. 67. through the fourth, ultimate sparks of the intimate fire. 68. yet to all it shall seem beautiful. its enemies who say not so, are mere liars. 69. there is success. 70. i am the hawk-headed lord of silence & of strength; my nemyss shrouds the night-blue sky. 71. hail! ye twin warriors about the pillars of the world! for your time is nigh at hand. 72. i am the lord of the double wand of power; the wand of the force of coph nia--but my left hand is empty, for i have crushed an universe; & nought remains. 73. paste the sheets from right to left and from top to bottom: then behold! 74. there is a splendour in my name hidden and glorious, as the sun of midnight is ever the son. 75. the ending of the words is the word abrahadabra. the book of the law is written and concealed. aum. ha.";

of the kings of aegypt he hath established his rule in his kingdom yet the father also boweth unto the power of the star and thereby in his subtlety he expandeth it all into twelve rays of the crown and these twelve rays are one vii then in the might of the lion did i formulate unto myself that holy and formless fire which darteth and flasheth through the depths of the universe at the touch of the fire qadosh the earth melted into a liquor clear as water at the touch of the fire qadosh the water smoked into a lucid air at the touch of the fire qadosh the air ignited and became fire at the touch of the fire qadosh o lord the fire dissipated into space at the touch of the fire qadosh o lord the space resolved itself into a profundity of mind at the touch of the fire qadosh the mind of the father was broken up into the brilliance of our lord the sun at the touch of the fire qadosh the brilliance of our lord was absorbed in the naught of our lady of the body of the milk of the stars then only was the fire qadosh extinguished when the enterer was driven back from the threshold and the lord of silence was established upon the lotus flower then was accomplished all that which was to be accomplished and all and one and naught were slain in the slaying of the warrior in the slaying of the subtlety that expanded all these things into the twelve rays of the crown that returned unto one and beyond one even unto the vision of the fool in his folly that chanted the word ararita and beyond the word and the fool yea beyond the word and the fool";
